rail safety should document their rationale describing how the sample sizes they have selected provide sufficient information to mitigate risks to rail safety within an acceptable resource cost.
"we found that randomness is not well understood by rail safety inspectors (rsis) and, in the majority of cases, randomness is compromised by how inspection entities are selected and thus the results are not representative of the larger population."
rail safety has been treating all defects equally and not distinguishing between major defects that may constituent a threat to rail safety and those that although still important would be considered less-critical.
"areas requiring further attention rail safety should improve the application of its risk-based business planning procedure and related sampling methodology to address the issues we identified above related to risk ranking, sample size, randomness and defining defects for calculating defect rates."
this will provide data to incorporate into the risk-based business planning process.
tsb r14-05: the department of transport audit the safety management systems of railways in sufficient depth and frequency to confirm that the required processes are effective and that corrective actions are implemented to improve safety.
(spring 2014) track follow-up activity using the rail safety integrated gateway data system and use this information for risk-based business planning.
"internal audit-s assessment the required information is being inputted into rsig however, because of rsig-s limited reporting capacity, the information cannot easily be used for planning and analysis."
it will be important that a plan be in place to determine how best to analyze this information in support of national risk-based planning and allocation of resources to areas of highest risk.
"the procedure then requires inspectors to determine the level of follow-up activity that is warranted, based on the risk associated with the deficiency identified."
our file review indicated that 53% of files requiring a checklist had one.
"even though not all checklists were being completed, there was evidence in all regions that inspectors did not accept a rail company-s corrective action plan for identified deficiencies until they were satisfied that the plan was adequate."
"(spring 2014) a quality assurance plan was established, using a risk based approach, which includes periodic assessments of oversight activities."
"while we did see oversight, we did not see the required checklists being consistently used to document the oversight."
"as well, there was no evidence that information collected by hq through the management review process was being analyzed to identify opportunities for improvement."
"a methodology should be developed for analyzing individual results and applying the lessons learned throughout the organization, as appropriate."
"the quality and performance management unit in rail safety is responsible for completing annual internal assessments on various procedures (e.g., risk-based planning procedure, inspection procedures etc)."
"internal audit-s assessment based on our review, the work that has been completed is consistent with the management action plan."
"to further minimize the risk of conflicts of interest, guidance is required to define -cooling off- periods."
"inspector training with respect to training, a learning curriculum is in place with mandatory training on sms, audits, risk and rsig."
"although it takes approximately three months for inspectors to obtain the necessary credentials to carry out inspections on their own, there is no specific guidance for managers with respect to an appropriate elapsed period of time before inspectors should conduct work at sites where they were previously employed, known as a -cooling off- period."
areas requiring further attention rail safety should work with transport canada-s values and ethics group to develop multi-modal guidelines for an appropriate -cooling off- period.
transportation safety board recommendations class 111 tank cars recommendation tsb r14-01 the department of transport and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration require that all class 111 tank cars used to transport flammable liquids meet enhanced protection standards that significantly reduce the risk of product loss when these cars are involved in accidents.
"department-s action plan in response to tsb recommendation r14-01, tc indicated that it will prohibit the use of the highest-risk group of pre-cpc-1232 class 111 tanks cars."
"in the interim, the train routing restrictions outlined in tc-s response to recommendation r14-02 (see section 4.1.2.2) are designed to reduce the associated risks."
the rules are not approved and the emergency directive was extended until such time as new rules are approved.
"this protective direction, in effect 150 days from the issue date, requires an erap for certain higher-risk hydrocarbons and flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, when offered for transport or imported by rail in 1 or more tank cars that are each filled to 10% of capacity or more."
"protective direction no. 33 (pd 33) was issued in april 2014 and extended the requirement for an emergency response assistance plan (erap) to certain higher risk liquid hydrocarbons (class 3, flammable liquids in packing groups i, ii and iii)."
interim approvals were granted based on response organizations demonstrating that a combination of training and experience of their technical advisors was sufficient to properly support firefighters.
this combination of training and experience addresses the lack of a recognized industry standard for response to an oil-on-rail fire.
tc will continue to work with the railway industry to identify and address any possible residual risks well in advance of the rule submission deadline.
"should any unforeseen vulnerabilities be identified that are not addressed sufficiently in the rule proposed by industry, tc would issue an amended emergency directive to immediately address any such issues."
"rail safety personnel will develop and implement targeted oversight requirements related to new rule(s) focused directly on securing trains; and identify and challenge any technical gaps in railways- risk assessments and provide technical advice/ direction on new securement rules, special instructions, and daily bulletins/ safety issues identified by inspectors in the field."
"recognizing that technological solutions may provide for additional improvements to mitigate risks of runaway trains in the coming years, tc will intensify its collaboration with industry through the railway research advisory board to help lead the implementation of technologies to enhance railway safety."
"although much work and consultation has been done, a final rule has not yet been approved under section 19 of the railway safety act."
the policy for payment of institute advisory board member expenses is not in compliance with the cihr act (criterion 21b).
"the institutes are integral to cihr and several requirements pertaining to them are included in cihr-s enabling legislation, the cihr act."
"one of these requirements is to reimburse expenses for institute advisory board (iab) members on a basis fixed by the governor-in-council; in other words, in accordance with government of canada policies."
non-compliance with legislation could result in reputational damage or additional scrutiny in future years.
b) a process should be established with defined accountabilities and responsibilities to verify all proposed program changes against legislative requirements and with the proper subject matter experts.
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the finance branch has recently assumed overall responsibility for the isg program."
"as a result, the finance branch is currently in the process of developing a clear and comprehensive framework to effectively manage the isg program."
the framework will outline specific responsibilities and accountabilities for management of the isg program.
"this framework will include: a summary of all key policies and procedures to ensure the program-s adherence to the cihr act, (including reimbursement of iab member expenses), the federal policy and directive on transfer payments, the terms and conditions for the isg program and all other legislative requirements."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all proposed program changes will be reviewed to ensure legislative requirements are accounted for."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a documented process for ensuring that any program changes are in adherence with legislative requirements.
expected completion: june 2015 there is no process to ensure modifications to the isg program are assessed for compliance with the isg t&c (criterion 3).
"t&c for transfer payment programs are initially approved by treasury board, and authority for approving subsequent changes varies depending on the significance of the change."
ministers are authorized to approve minor amendments and may also delegate this authority to the deputy head of the organization.
the isg terms and conditions (t&c) approved in 2008 state that sds may be appointed for terms up to 7 years.
"starting in 2009, sd terms were extended to a total of 8 years."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all proposed program changes will be reviewed to ensure the isg t&c-s requirements are accounted for."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: ensuring that a clear process is established for amending the terms and conditions of the isg program as required.
"expected completion: june, 2015."
"deficiencies in the reporting and monitoring of planned and actual isg expenditures have resulted in an impairment to manage the release of funds to the institutes (criteria 18, 19f, 25, 26)."
"at the start of each fiscal year, sds are required to submit an annual budget of planned expenditures for their institute, categorized by eligible expense type."
an annual financial report detailing actual expenditures by eligible category is due to cihr by june 30 for the preceding fiscal year.
the report format and expense categories are prescribed by cihr.
"the annual financial reports are recorded by cihr finance into a spreadsheet maintained since the start of the program and more recently, forecast and actual expenditures have been combined into one place with the intent to perform variance analysis."
"a review of the financial information as part of this audit revealed that the program carried an overall unspent balance of between $5.5m and $7.35m over the last six fiscal years ending on march 31, 2014."
"as a result, cihr may have missed opportunities to reallocate and maximize the use of available isg funds within the existing t&c."
"b) institutes should be provided with guidelines regarding the reporting of expenses, to ensure consistency in reporting of expenditures."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a monitoring regime of planned and actual expenditures to effectively inform program decisions, including the release of future funding."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: guidelines for the institutes regarding the reporting of isg expenses."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
the program t&c specify that the isg continues as long as the recipient meets the eligibility requirements.
eligible recipients are defined in the t&c as -canadian institutions that host a cihr institute headed by an sd affiliated with them-.
"when an institute transitions to a new host institution, the previous recipient ceases to meet the eligibility requirements."
"the isg ends, funded activities cease, and the grant is not eligible for renewal."
the isg agreement includes a provision for the recipient to repay the outstanding balance to cihr at the end of the grant and the directive on transfer payments requires amounts repayable to be recorded as debts to the crown.
the practice of transferring unspent balances to the new host institution is not in compliance with the directive on transfer payments.
"b) alternate approaches should be considered to eliminate large balances at the end of an isg; for example, reduce the funding to the outgoing institution for the last year of its grant, thus avoiding a large unspent balance when the grant expires."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all unspent funds at the end of a grant will be returned to cihr as per the isg agreement."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a clear process in compliance with the directive on transfer payments for what happens to unspent isg funds at the end of a scientific director-s term.
"expected completion: june, 2015."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - addressed in the response to recommendation 4a) expected completion: june, 2015."
the institute support grant agreement template is not fully compliant with the requirements in the amended terms and conditions and the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 3).
the isg agreement formalizes the arrangements between cihr and the host institution for the hosting of the institute.
"the following items are missing: an indemnification clause to the benefit of the crown as per requirement 8 of the directive, appendix f; a provision for making information public per requirement 14 of the directive, appendix f; and a clause regarding official languages, as mandated by the t&c and requirement 16) of the directive, appendix f."
missing elements may result in exposure to cihr through increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders.
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an updated template for isg agreements to ensure adherence to all key legislative requirements."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
"in order to be awarded an isg, the host institution is required to complete and submit an application for funding."
elements that must be included in the application for the grant are defined by the program t&c.
"in the case of a grant, the application is the main mechanism to obtain information from the potential recipient regarding their eligibility for the grant and confirm their understanding of the approved uses of the funding."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all new applications will include all elements as described in the t&c the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an updated isg application form to ensure all key criteria of the terms and conditions are addressed, including sd assignment and coi requirements."
"expected completion: june, 2015. process documentation when an institute transitions requires improvement (criteria 1c, 1d, 2b, 2c)."
"gc has fulfilled its responsibility to establish and maintain the institutes through the initial creation of the 13 institutes, the establishment of a support function within cihr and the appointment of sds and iab members."
"gc has periodically reviewed the mandates and performance of the institutes through two international reviews, a mid-term evaluation of the institutes and most recently, the institute model review."
"key areas where processes are lacking include: appointment of new sds and transition of the institute to a different host institution; criteria and responsibilities for the review and approval of the application for the isg received from the host institution; responsibilities and requirements for the development of the isg funding agreement; and orientation, including training and awareness on responsibilities, for the new sd and host institute staff."
the documentation that exists to support the transition of institutes and orientation of the sd and host institute staff needs updating.
"currently, these activities primarily rely on corporate memory and informal discussions between ottawa-based institute staff (obis) members."
"in addition, as a result of the most recent institute model review, the obis role will no longer exist as a distinct entity and the staff and their responsibilities will be reassigned to other portfolios."
areas to be addressed include: sd appointment & transition ; hi application review; development of the isg agreement; and orientation of sd and hi staff.
"a) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the audit recommendation for #7 coincides with a key hr deliverable for the 2015-16 fiscal year: hr is assuming responsibility for the activities formerly led by institute affairs, including the recruitment of sd-s, offer/appointment letters, renewal letters, institute transitions and orientation (finance will be responsible for the isg agreements)."
"as part of assuming these responsibilities, hr will lead process mapping and improvement exercises following lean process improvement methodologies to ensure all activities are identified, roles are clarified and efficiencies are implemented."
"formal documentation, assignment of roles, communication of processes will be a part of the change management plan."
the institutes manage records that are part of cihr's information holdings and are subject to the access to information and privacy acts (atip) and treasury board policies.
some institutes have implemented a defined information management records structure.
"the sd is notified of his/her obligations with respect to recordkeeping and atip in their letter of offer and in the newly instated performance plan, but beyond that initial discussion there are currently minimal support mechanisms and controls in place to ensure the proper management of cihr's records."
the planned implementation of infonet and secure access to the cihr intranet for the institutes will improve the institutes- ability to manage information in accordance with gc requirements.
"b) cihr's information management staff should support the institutes through adequate procedures, tools and training on their information management responsibilities, including access to information, privacy and security requirements."
"a) responsibility chief information officer action agreed information management (im) roles and responsibilities will be addressed with the infonet implementation which is scheduled to start in june, 2015. im awareness is part of the infonet implementation strategy."
expected completion august 2015.
b) responsibility chief information officer action agreed the im team is currently updating its im training and awareness materials.
new materials will be posted on the intranet and invitations to training sessions will be sent in the fall.
the im team will ensure that the institutes are part of the communications strategy.
expected completion march 2016.
the responsibility and accountability for support to the sds and institute staff for official languages is not documented (criterion 14).
the institutes are an extension of cihr and represent cihr to the research community and to the canadian public.
"as such, there is an obligation for the institutes to comply with the sections of the official languages act (ola) relating to service delivery (part iv of the act) and the advancement of both official languages (part vii), including consideration of linguistic minority communities."
the responsibilities of the sd in relation to parts iv and vii of the act as described above are laid out in the internal cihr policy on official language.
the obis staff members play a key role in ensuring that institute activities are in compliance with these official languages requirements.
"for examples, when planning a conference, ensuring that all communications and materials are available in both languages."
"gaps in this area could diminish cihr-s ability to engage with its stakeholders, impact cihr's reputation in the scholarly community and with the public, and could result in an official languages complaint against the agency."
"b) sds should be fully informed of their obligations under the ola through documentation, awareness and training."
"a) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the director hr (employee focus) co-chairs the official languages sub-committee with an rkte director (external/community focus)."
an updated official languages policy and action plan has recently been approved by eemc/emc.
the official languages policy clarifies roles and responsibilities.
"formal documentation, assignment of roles, communication of processes will be a part of the change management plan."
expected completion in progress.
"b) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the official languages policy and action plan have been shared with scientific directors at science council."
new scientific directors will receive information about the official languages policy and their role as part of the new integrated onboarding at cihr.
the official languages sub-committee will continue to implement and monitor the official languages action plan.
expected completion in progress.
"current performance reporting for the institutes is comprised of the performance measures defined through the management results reporting structure, and reported in the annual departmental performance report."
the two measures include partner investment in institute-driven research and stakeholder collaboration on institute-driven research.
the institutes also prepare and submit an annual report to governing council.
"the annual reports are focused on the allocation of the $8.6m research funding that is initiated through the institutes, as well as partnerships and total cihr investment in the areas covered by the institute-s mandate."
institute impacts are reported via case studies.
there are neither performance measures nor reporting specific to the outcomes of the isg funding.
"while much of the isg budget is allocated to the costs related to day-to-day functioning of the institute - salaries, office space, equipment, etc. - funding is also used for institute development and engagement of the research community."
a requirement for sds to provide a plan of activities to support their annual isg budget is documented in the letter sent to confirm their appointment.
these should be considered in the context of the performance measures established for the overall institutes and the isi and performance expectations established for the sds.
"a) responsibility director, performance and accountability action agreed cihr is currently implementing the recommendations of the gc institute model review."
"as part of this recommendation, a new framework for evaluating the impact of the institutes is currently being developed."
expected completion june 2016.
"expected completion november, 2015."
"in the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could improve systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to the institute support grants."
we have documented these observations in a management letter and are satisfied with management-s response.
there is no process to ensure modifications to the isg program are assessed for compliance with the isg t&c.
the institute support grant agreement template is not fully compliant with the requirements in the amended terms and conditions and the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments.
"failure to comply with the treasury board (tb) policies for transfer payment programs, the program terms and conditions, and the cihr act could result in reduction of funding, increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders process documentation when an institute transitions requires improvement."
appendix audit criteria and conclusions the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that the institute support grant has moderate issues.
gaps in reporting and monitoring of institute spending have resulted in funds being potentially released to the institutes in advance of need.
"improvements in the documentation of key processes will provide consistency in dealings with the institutes, particularly in light of the dissolution of the ottawa-based institute staff (obis) and reassignment of their responsibilities to other cihr portfolios."
criteria reference to observations
risk and impact cihr is not in compliance with its legislation with respect to the reimbursement of iab member expenses.
"while the financial exposure is limited, given that most institution travel policies are less generous than government rates, the greater risk identified is that there is no defined mechanism to verify program policies and processes against the cihr act."
(table 1 - risk 1) a) the requirement for host institutions to reimburse iab members as per government of canada policy should be documented and communicated to the institutes.
modification to the t&c without the proper authority puts cihr and its senior management at risk of non-compliance with tb policy.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) a process should be established with defined accountabilities and responsibilities to verify all proposed program changes against the isg t&c.
"the process should include review by the relevant offices of primary interest, including legal and finance, to determine the appropriate approval authority in accordance with the policy on transfer payments."
reports are not always received in a timely manner and the expense categories are not always used consistently.
"however, the information is not reviewed or used to make decisions regarding funding the program or to assess funding needs."
"risk and impact this lack of oversight has resulted in cihr not complying with the directive on transfer payments' requirements to fund institutes at the minimum level required to achieve the program goals, and to not pay grant funds in advance of need."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) a monitoring regime with defined accountabilities and responsibilities should be established to ensure financial reports are received by cihr in a timely manner and reviewed as input to program decisions, including the release of future funding."
unspent balances returned to cihr when institutes transition to a new host institution are not handled in accordance with the program t&c and the requirements of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 19g).
the current practice that treats the institute transition as a renewal of the grant and transfers any unspent isg balance to the new host institution is contrary to the t&c.
risk and impact the current process of continuing the isg but changing the grant recipient is not in compliance with the program t&c.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) unspent funds at the end of the grant should be returned to cihr as per the isg agreement and managed and accounted for in accordance with the directive on transfer payments.
"while a template for the agreement exists and is consistently used, the agreement does not currently reflect the complete program t&c and the requirements defined by treasury board for transfer payment programs."
"risk and impact without all of the required elements, the isg program is not fully compliant with the tbs directive on transfer payments."
required elements for funding agreements are defined to ensure funding agreements minimize risks to cihr and enable programs to achieve their objectives.
host institutions may not be aware of all their obligations.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) the isg agreement should be reviewed and updated to accurately reflect the t&c of the program and tb requirements.
the application form for an isg does not contain all the elements as required by the amended t&c (criterion 9).
"in addition, the host institution may not have a clear understanding of its obligations under the isg program."
"however, gaps exist in the documentation of processes to ensure the smooth transition of an institute when a new sd is appointed and the institute moves to a new host institution."
risk and impact the lack of documentation coupled with the loss of the dedicated support and corporate memory provided by obis staff increases the risk of inconsistency in handling institute transitions.
the sd and institute staff may not receive all the necessary training and information required to fully understanding and comply with their obligations under the isg.
"(table 1 - risk 2) a) the processes, accountabilities and responsibilities in support of key institute activities should be documented or updated if documentation currently exists."
"risk and impact without adequate awareness, training and support regarding their information management responsibilities, the institutes and their sds may fail to protect cihr records, corporate memory may be lost, and the private information of canadian may not be adequately protected or available as required by atip, and the tb policy on information management and directive on recordkeeping."
(table 1 - risk 2) a) sds should be made aware of their accountabilities and responsibilities for managing information created by the institutes.
"although this support requirement is well understood among current obis staff, it is not documented as a responsibility in the obis role profiles, an issue which is exacerbated with the dissolution of the obis roles and re-assignment of staff members within cihr."
"(table 1 - risk 2) a) the responsibilities for supporting the institutes regarding their ola responsibilities should be clarified, documented, and assigned to the new parties responsible once the obis staff has been moved to their new roles."
specific performance measures are not in place for the institute support grant program (criterion 16b).
"risk and impact without specific and meaningful performance and reporting measures for the isg program, cihr's senior management cannot determine how effectively the institutes are using their funding to further institute and cihr objectives."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) cihr should include specific and meaningful performance measures for the isg as part of the regular assessment of institute performance and relevance."
"based on this work, a performance measurement strategy and logic model will be developed which will ensure performance measures for the isg are identified and tracked."
there is no ongoing risk monitoring of the isg program (criterion 24).
"a risk assessment for the isg program was completed as part of the tbs submission for the amended t&c in 2008. it identified three new risks as a result of the changes made to the t&c, along with compensating controls: risk: planned outcomes are not achieved control: on-going monitoring of success control: continued efforts at increasing the resource available for health research control: increasing public knowledge and awareness of value of health research control: program rationalization to focus resources on key priority areas risk: institute transitions, control: institute transition plan risk: misuse of funds no specific actions; considered low risk due to low amount of money (in relation to all funds managed by host institutions) and experience of host institutions in managing grant funds there is no ongoing monitoring of these risks to determine if the mitigating actions have been implemented and are successful, or if the risks need to be updated as a result of changes in the environment."
"risk and impact without ongoing monitoring of the internal and external environment, it is not known if mitigation actions have been implemented, have achieved the desired results or if the identified risks themselves still apply."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) a process should be established to monitor risks to the program on a cyclical basis to determine if: existing risks as defined are still valid; there are additional risks that should be assessed; and mitigating actions for defined risks have been implemented and are effective."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an ongoing risk assessment and monitoring process to ensure all isg program risks are identified, updated and effectively mitigated."
table 1 - analysis of crosscutting risks and impacts the following table maps the audit observations to the identified program risks across observations (horizontally) and further describes the potential impacts to cihr: risk observation mapping to audit specific risk and impacts the policy for payment of institute advisory board member expenses is not in compliance with the cihr act.
unspent balances returned to cihr when institutes transition to a new host institution are not handled in accordance with the program t&c and the requirements of the directive on transfer payments.
the application form for an isg does not contain all the elements as required by the amended t&c.
specific performance measures are not in place for the institute grant support program.
there is no ongoing risk monitoring of the isg program.
decision-making and planning may not be based on accurate and/or sufficient information.
the overall conclusion considers the cumulative risk exposure related to the audit observations in the context of the above criteria.
"deficiencies exist in compliance with policy; however, the non-compliant areas themselves have not resulted in significant exposure."
"management responses are included and provide: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and, a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan."
"it security governance the audit expected that aafc and cfia have it security frameworks that include a defined governance structure, including defined roles and responsibilities related to aafc and cfia-s relationship with ssc."
aafc and cfia staffs remain responsible for some of the smaller data centres in the regions.
"in some cases aafc and cfia staff were unsure of their role in relation to these data centres, given ssc owns the it infrastructure equipment in these data centres."
"ssc has administrative access to servers containing aafc and cfia data, including file shares on aafc and cfia network drives, and there is no formal mechanism between ssc and aafc to discuss or track this access."
"some activities, for example tape backups that are now the responsibility of ssc, are still being conducted in some regions by aafc and cfia staff."
"specific to aafc, there is a transition plan in place for aafc to take back responsibility for the antivirus software that is currently being administered by ssc."
"specific to cfia, the employee that managed the antivirus system moved to ssc and cfia is unaware of any activities that are currently being conducted related to this."
"the mandates and roles of it security oversight bodies are consistent with leading practices and understood by key stakeholders within the department; furthermore, these governance bodies meet on a regular basis."
key it security governance committees include: departmental security management committee (dsmc); security and identity steering committee (sisc); and it security working group (itswg).
the itswg membership outlined in the dsp contemplates significant representation from ssc.
ssc was only specifically mentioned in the minutes and records of decision in two of the seven itswg meetings.
"findings specific to cfia cfia has established the security program management committee (spmc), a consultative and review committee that reports through the agency governance structure, and is mandated to assist in the planning and implementation of the agency security plan (asp)."
some laboratories have fairly significant separate networks (e.g. up to 50 computers and one server) and proprietary software.
"recommendations aafc 1 - the assistant deputy minister (adm), isb, in collaboration with the adm, cmb, should ensure aafc further defines roles and responsibilities between itself and ssc in relation to it security, and as part of that process update and formalize the terms of reference for it security - related governance committees."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, dg smd; adm cmb, dg amcp; ssc dg, client relationships & business intake cfia 1- the vice president, imit, in collaboration with the vice president, corporate management, should ensure that the it security governance framework is strengthened, through a reinvigorated security program management committee (spmc)."
"cfia should either leverage an existing operational-level committee, or establish a new committee, to ensure there is a forum for the discussion of it security issues on a more tactical basis and that encourages collaboration between it security and areas such as science and operations, as well as ssc."
this should include cfia further defining roles and responsibilities between itself and ssc in relation to it security.
cfia 1 management response: management accepts the recommendation.
"action plan: management will create an it security governance framework that will specify how it security will be governed using the existing governance committees and will seek opportunities with other existing committees where input can be provided by other relevant stakeholders, such as the security program management committee, on which other branches participate."
target date for completion: march 2016 management will continue to engage ssc in discussions aimed at further definition of roles and responsibilities of both parties.
"findings specific to aafc the aafc departmental security plan (dsp) was completed in february 2012, and the plan is next scheduled to be updated and reissued in april 2015."
"aafc and ssc are working together, at the initiation of aafc, on addressing the top 35 it security controls list from communication security establishment canada (csec) related to aafc controls."
"findings specific to cfia cfia has developed a five year agency security plan (asp) in 2012 to cover 2012-13 to 2017-18, with the intent to refresh the document annually as required."
it was further noted that these issues were identified in over 10 previous tras conducted for the agency.
this action links to #7.2.
"target date for completion: july 31, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration with cmb dg amcp, will incorporate the latter process (item 2.2) as a formal input into the overall departmental security plan (dsp) and is aligned with dsp schedule."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, dg smd; adm cmb, dg amcp cfia 2 management response: management accepts the recommendation."
"target date for completion: draft model developed october 2015; completion april 2016 lead(s) responsible: vice president, imit; ed, strategic planning and management third party management the audit expected that aafc and cfia have developed formal processes to ensure it security is considered during contracting and/or the development of agreements with third party vendors utilized for the delivery of it services."
the aafc it security policy section includes requirements for the contracting for it services.
"furthermore, security activities undertaken by the dso in 2012-13 included a development of a new aafc security in contracting standard, the development of a new it security annex for contracts, and the tracking of all security requirements checklists (srcls) via a database."
"at aafc, the im/it security and supply management division is responsible to support all im/it managers in all their requests for professional services, and is intended to centralize and standardize all im/it procurements."
"departmental security services (dss) reviews all contracts for security requirements, and as required, consults with the itsrm team."
"findings specific to cfia cfia utilizes a number of third parties as it service providers, outside of ssc, the most significant being aafc, which hosts cfia-s financial (i.e. sap) and hr (i.e. peoplesoft) systems."
"cfia utilizes third parties outside of government for some key agency activities, this includes an organization that collects and manages livestock identification information on behalf of the agency, and a number of third party laboratories that conduct sample collection and testing on behalf of the agency."
there is no formally documented process through the contracting process to ensure it security is consulted or to ensure it security is considered during the development of agreements or memorandum of understanding (mou).
"neither the mou with the organization that manages livestock identification information or the sample contract reviewed with the third party laboratory included specific security requirements, other than a high level acknowledgement that the information would only be used for purposes that related to the agreement / contract."
"neither document outlined the security incident and/or breach management process, or the processes related to the termination of the agreement / contract (e.g. retention and disposition of agency information)."
"recommendation cfia 3 - the vice president, imit, in collaboration with the vice president, corporate management, should ensure that a formally documented process is developed that ensures it security is consulted in relation to agreements and contracts and that where required, third party adherence to security requirements is assessed and monitored. cfia 3 management response: management accepts the recommendation."
pwgsc ensures that safeguarding requirements are adhered to through periodic audits as established by cfia.
the findings identified by the audit team include opportunities to improve the existing measures.
"aafc has developed an it security program framework, including it security policies and user guidance, which covers key it security related content, including at a high-level, the classification and safeguarding of sensitive digital information."
aafc has also worked with the communications security establishment canada (csec) on a cyber security project which included identifying those areas that manage classified information at aafc.
aafc is leveraging both internal networks and those of federal government partners for the processing and transmission of classified information.
"within some program areas that handle a significant amount of classified data, there is a reliance on standalone laptops to process secret information, with information shared between users on usb keys, and backed up on an external hard drive."
"classified information is also processed and transmitted through less secure means, for example through the use of usb keys and within it systems not accredited to process secret information."
protected information is not being formally classified or labelled in a consistent fashion throughout the department.
"many program areas, especially those in the regions and at research labs, are still utilizing network drives to maintain at least some of their information, including protected information and information of a proprietary nature with intellectual property rights."
aafc has developed a business case that was approved for the secure use of portable storage devices project and a project charter and project management plan has been developed.
the intent of the project is to implement controls that are in line with the requirements of the may 2014 treasury board secretariat (tbs) information technology policy implementation notice on the secure use of portable data storage devices within the government of canada.
"findings specific to cfia cfia has implemented an it security program framework including the cfia it security directive and has developed guidance related to the identification, labelling, and safeguarding of protected and classified information."
"cfia has developed an e-learning national security program, which includes a dedicated module on it security, which all cfia employees are mandated to be taken by september 2015. employees must then subsequently take a condensed version of the course each time they renew their id cards every five years."
"given this, examples were cited that secret information may be emailed through a password protected document or transferred through unsecure usb keys."
there is no process for the regular review of security measures implemented by cfia inspectors at establishments.
"cfia has developed a travel security protocol that applies to staff travelling for the agency outside of the country. as part of the protocol, staff members are provided a briefing, and may be provided -loaner- laptops and mobile devices from imit to be used while out of the country."
"implementation of the protocol has currently been ad hoc, and generally at the request of staff."
"recommendations aafc 3 / cfia 4 - the adm, isb / vp, imit in collaboration with the aafc adm, cmb and cfia vp, corporate management should ensure that procedures, training, and tools related to the identification, labelling, and management of classified (e.g. secret) and protected information within the department are developed and implemented to ensure compliance and improve awareness."
this includes limiting the use of network drives for the storage of sensitive information.
aafc 3 management response: agree action plan: cmb dg amcp will review and update departmental information classification guide and supporting documentation.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration with cmb dg amcp, will update it security policy to ensure clarity on how protected and classified information can be processed using it systems at aafc and communicate the updated policy to managers and staff."
"target date for completion: december 31, 2015 cmb dg amcp will continue to promote the current web-based training course for aafc staff which includes handling of protected and classified information (hard copy and electronic) and ensure the currency of related tools such as web content and awareness pamphlets."
"furthermore, specific scenario-based training will be developed to address the handling of sensitive information (protected and classified documents)."
the security awareness training is mandatory at aafc.
"in addition, all employees upon being granted or updated for their reliability status or security clearance must sign an ""acknowledgment of understanding - security responsibilities related to protected and classified information"" form, countersigned by their manager, which includes instructions on handling, transmission and packaging of both electronic and hard-copy protected and classified information."
"target date for completion: january 31, 2015 isb dg smd with review and update the statement of sensitivity template which is used to classify information being processed by it systems, to align with updated departmental information classification guide."
"target date for completion: april 30, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration with isb dg ims, will review security of systems designed to process protected information and to expand their use in order to limit use of network drives for protected information."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration with isb dg information management services (ims), as directed by the horizontal management committee (hmc) in alignment with gc and aafc priorities, will implement systems for more secure processing of classified information and to reduce the reliance of shared drives for the storage of sensitive information."
"target date for completion: december 31, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm cmb, dg amcp; adm isb, dg smd, dg ims cfia 4 management response: management accepts the recommendation."
"action plan: as the cfia network is not accredited to process classified and protected electronic information, alternative have been provided."
"a multi-year effort to strengthen mobile device security has been initiated, beginning with the implementation of hard drive encryption."
target date for completion: ongoing education and awareness: launched mandatory on-line learning modules for cfia employees on the management of sensitive information.
"target date for completion: completed publication of guide to educate employees on procedures for identifying, labelling, transmitting and storing protected and classified information."

"target date for completion: ongoing continue regular messaging from the agency security officer to promote awareness for the security and protection of information with emphasis on compliance including the procedures for handling classified information in a secure manner, off the network."
"aafc 4 management response: agree action plan: there is an electronic device (laptop, blackberry) -loaner- program in place at aafc for employees travelling abroad."
"cmb dg amcp will provide, on a regular basis, reminders to all staff regarding travel responsibilities to increase awareness and remind them of the existing guidelines, procedures, and -loaner- device program."
these guidelines and procedures will be reviewed regularly to ensure they address the evolving security environment.
"target date for completion: october 31, 2014 isb director it client services will update the it equipment travel -loaner- process to include tracking utilization and providing departmental security services (dss) with access to this information."
report on monitoring to departmental security officer (dso) and senior management on quarterly basis or as required.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm smd, dg amcp; adm isb, director it client services cfia 5 - the vice president, imit in collaboration with the vice president corporate management, should ensure that adherence to the travel security protocol becomes mandatory for all staff within the agency, and adherence to the process is monitored. cfia 5 management response: management accepts the recommendation."
action plan: policy promulgate the agency travel security directive to provide employees with direction on travel security.
target date for completion: may 2015 security and accommodation services and international coordination committee to identify travellers that require a travel security briefing.
target date for completion: ongoing security and accommodation services will conduct regular verifications of agency travel request sources to ensure employee compliance with the travel security directive.
"for the data centre in one of the regional / area offices used by both aafc and cfia, access is controlled by cfia, given that there are no ssc personnel in the region that support regional operations."
"aafc and cfia staff remain responsible for some of the smaller data centres / server rooms within aafc research centres and regions, and cfia district offices and laboratories."
staff could not recall the last time the pin was changed.
"furthermore, the server cage was unlocked."
"findings specific to cfia for a cfia area office visited for testing, in which the data centre on site has been transferred to ssc, cfia staff on site continue to manage the access card process."
there were also several cards that were active but -spares- reserved for contractors.
"for the cfia laboratories included in the audit, access to the server room was restricted by a key, and a limited number of authorized staff had access."
"in order to gain access to the server room, an individual would first need to gain access to the laboratory building-s themselves, which are restricted."
"recommendation aafc 5 / cfia 6 - the adm, isb / vp, imit in collaboration with the aafc adm, cmb and cfia vp, corporate management should engage ssc to ensure roles and responsibilities for the granting, and regular review, of server room access is formalized."
"aafc 5 management response: agree action plan: isb director of client services and cmb dg amcp, in collaboration with ssc, will develop an inventory of aafc physical locations that contain servers and related it infrastructure and document current access control process, roles and responsibilities."
"target date for completion: march 31, 2015 isb dg smd and cmd dg amcp, in collaboration with ssc, will formally identify and agree to roles, responsibilities and procedures including oversight for access and control of all physical locations identified to ensure adequate restriction of physical access to it infrastructure."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm cmb, dg amcp; adm isb, dg smd, director it client services; ssc dg, client relationships & business intake cfia 6 management response: management accepts the recommendation."
"target date for completion: december 2015 formalize agreement between cfia and ssc which clarifies roles and responsibilities for the review, approval and granting of access rights to server rooms."
target date for completion: december 2015 conduct regular review and updates of access lists to ensure that only authorized ssc employees are granted access to server rooms.
the purpose of certification / assessment is to verify that the security requirements established for a particular system or service are met and that the controls and safeguards work as intended.
findings specific to aafc aafc established an sa&a framework in 2012 for which all new isb systems and critical legacy systems must follow.
"roles and responsibilities have been formally documented and the process has been incorporated into the departmental im/it portfolio management framework, and the system development life cycle (sdlc)."
"of note, for critical systems, itsrm has ensured they are made aware of any changes to the system through the formal request for change (rfc) and their attendance at change control committee."
"imit planning staff has recently developed a tracking and costing estimate sheet to track it enabled projects and ensure that costs, including those for it security, are included in project estimates."
technical vulnerability assessments (vas) have generally not been performed.
"recommendations aafc 6 - the adm, isb should ensure that a formal authorization to operate is in place for all critical systems within the department."
"aafc 6 management response: agree action plan: isb dg smd, in collaboration with ssc, will ensure that formal authorization to operation is completed for all the outstanding aafc critical systems by completing the remaining security assessment reports and obtaining adm level authorization from aafc and ssc."
"aafc 7 management response: agree action plan: isb dg smd will update the departmental im/it portfolio management framework, templates and checklist and ensure that project managers and directors are aware that formal security controls must be identified, used as input to system requirements, and approved by investment planning committee prior to moving forward to the planning phase deliverables."
existing critical systems should be revisited to ensure an authorization to operate is obtained and reevaluated on a periodic basis.
cfia 7 management response: management accepts the recommendation.
procurement of 7.1 is currently underway.
"note: the time, scope and cost of items 7.2 - 7.4 below are dependent on the completion of item 7.1. therefore, target dates provided for these items are broad estimates only and subject to change."
"once this program is in place, all new systems will be subject to it."
the audit assessed logical access controls within aafc and cfia through a more detailed review of a number of it systems.
controls related to the timely removal of the network access of employees were also reviewed.
"as part of the exit process described above, there is no formal process to ensure that this occurs."
the audit team selected a sample of non-critical aafc systems to review logical access controls.
critical aafc systems (such as sap) were not included in the sample as similar it security audits are planned by external bodies such as the ocg and aafc internal audit plans to conduct an audit focusing on sap in 2015-16.
none of the it systems reviewed in detail as part of the audit have a formally documented process in place to regularly review user access.
"the form is intended to be completed by the employee and submitted to hr, where it is scanned and put into rdims."
an email is then sent out from hr to the it service centre indicating the departure with a rdims link to the departure from agency form.
"the it service centre accesses the document from rdims, pdfs it and attaches it to a ticket which it generates."
"as part of the exit process described above, there is no formal process to ensure that this occurs."
"related to password requirements, two of the four it systems audited do not have defined requirements, in terms of complexity or password changes."
none of the systems had a formal process to regularly review user access.
"recommendations aafc 8 / cfia 8 - the adm, isb / vp, imit in collaboration with the aafc adm, cmb and cfia vp, human resources should ensure that exit procedures and the adherence to them related to it assets, are further formalized throughout aafc / cfia, including provisions to ensure the timely removal of network access."
"aafc 8 management response: agree action plan: isb director it client services, in collaboration with the cmb dg amcp and cmb dg human resources (hr) will review, update and formalize current exit processes related to it assets and will implement mechanisms, including communications to staff and management, to ensure they are followed including timely removal of network access."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, director it client services; adm cmb, dg asset management and capital planning, dg hr cfia 8 management response: management accepts this recommendation."
"action plan: management will initiate a review of the exit procedures and develop a strategy to improve timelines of completion, and adherence by all managers and employees."
"target date for completion: december 31, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration with the isb dg ims, isb dg add, and isb director it client services will review all applications, starting with critical and high priority applications, to determine adherence to updated standards."
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 isb dg smd, in collaboration with the isb dg ims, isb dg add and isb director it client services, will update applications, where necessary, identified in# 9.3 to ensure that the necessary controls are implemented."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2016 isb dg smd will assess bi-annually the application updates made to ensure that the controls implemented are in line with the standard, as per item #2.2."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, dg smd, dg add, dg ims, director it client services; adm cmb, dg amcp cfia 9 management response: management accepts this recommendation."
"action plan: management will procure a senior consultant to develop a plan to address how application logical access controls are granted, reviewed, monitored and enforced."
the plan will address the management of privileged accounts and the assurance of segregation of duties.
"target date for completion: april 2016 lead(s) responsible: vice president, imit; ed, strategic planning and management annex a: audit criteria line of enquiry 1: a governance structure for it security has been established for the department / agency and its relationship with partners and third parties."
"accountabilities, delegations, reporting relationships, and roles and responsibilities for it security are defined, documented, and communicated to relevant persons."
"those charged with governance have clearly communicated mandates, are actively involved, have a significant level of influence, and exercise oversight of management processes."
"the oversight body meets regularly and reviews information related to it security priorities and plans, provides advice on issues, reviews performance of the it security function, and communicates its decisions to the organization in a timely manner."
"aafc / cfia have defined the governance, reporting, and communication requirements related to its relationship with shared services canada."
"it security roles and responsibilities of ssc have been formally defined, documented, and communicated."
a service level agreement with ssc exists and includes defined service levels for it security services and adherence to these requirements is monitored.
governance mechanisms are in place to ensure regular communication and review of information related to it security services provided by ssc.
a formal relationship with third party vendors other than ssc for the delivery of it services exists and governance mechanisms are in place to ensure defined business objectives are met.
a formal process for the selection of third party vendors other than ssc for the delivery of it services is in place and includes consideration of it security requirements.
"third party vendor agreements for vendors other than ssc include it security requirements and adherence to these requirements is regularly reported, monitored, and assessed."
"the sa&a process has been defined, documented, and communicated and incorporated into the system development life cycle."
it systems have been formally accredited and certified.
comprehensive operation security documentation has been developed that is applicable to the it system.
"requests for access to systems follow a formal process, are made by user management, approved by system owners, and in line with business needs."
a formal employee off boarding process includes the return of all information assets and the removal of all access rights from information systems.
user access is regularly reviewed and changes to user access permissions are made in a timely manner.
"this section presents the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provides recommendations for improvement."
"from a governance perspective, roles and responsibilities between aafc / cfia and ssc related to it security are not always clear and at an operational level, have not been comprehensively defined."
"this is indicated through a number of examples, including: aafc-s security assessment & authorization (sa&a) activities, including threat and risk assessments (tras) and technical vulnerability assessments (vas) identify application risks which are the responsibility of aafc / cfia versus infrastructure risks which fall under the responsibility of ssc."
there is a no mechanism in place for aafc / cfia to inform or receive acknowledgement from ssc on the infrastructure risks identified.
"although the transfer to ownership of larger data centres to ssc has taken place, aafc and cfia continue to be responsible for the actual granting of access to some of these locations, and in some cases ssc has requested aafc and cfia to update the access list."
"in one such situation, the backup tapes are kept for one year onsite and then moved across the street to a separate location, which is not a leading practice as this increases the risk of the loss of data if an incident such as a local disaster was to occur."
"specific to aafc, there is it infrastructure equipment at research labs that was installed by the isb staff at the lab that aafc now considers to be under ssc responsibility, but this has not been communicated to ssc."
this includes off the shelf wireless networking equipment purchased 15 years ago. findings specific to aafc aafc has a defined it security governance framework that involves the appropriate levels of management and representation from throughout the department.
"the terms of reference for the dsmc and sisc have not been updated since 2010, and, therefore does not consider the role of ssc."
there is no formal terms of reference document for the itswg; although a description of the mandate and membership of the itswg is documented in the aafc departmental security plan (dsp) from february 2012.
"although the spmc is intended to meet on a quarterly basis, given turnover at the agency security officer level, the committee only met twice during the 2013-14 fiscal year."
ssc was not specifically mentioned in the minutes for either of the two meetings.
a more operational working group focused on it security does not exist within the agency.
"there is a lack of forums for it security to be discussed, and for cfia it security to be made aware of the it security practices within cfia business lines, such as the science or operations branches."
"furthermore, responsibility for supply and care of these systems was to be transitioned from the science branch to the imit branch, although this has not occurred."
"aafc 1 management response: agree action plan: isb dg strategic management directorate (smd), in collaboration with appropriate shared services canada (ssc) dg counterpart(s), will review and document it security related roles and responsibilities."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2015 isb dg smd, in collaboration cmb dg asset management and capital planning (amcp), will update, formalize and obtain approval of the terms of reference for it security related governance committees in alignment with the action plan #1.1 to include appropriate ssc involvement."
"target date for completion: march 2016 internal governance within imit branch will be strengthened, to ensure that it security will be engaged early in the project management process, so that risks can be identified and addressed."
management will lead and/or participate in all appropriate government of canada fora that identify the processes for how ssc and departments work in partnership in regard to it security.
"target date for completion: april 2016 lead(s) responsible: vp, cmb; vice president, imit; ed, strategic planning and management it security risk management the audit expected that aafc and cfia adhere to treasury board baseline security requirements as outlined in the policy on government security."
"the policy requires each department / agency to establish a security program for the coordination and management of departmental security activities, and the proper management of security requires the continuous assessment of risks and the implementation, monitoring and maintenance of appropriate internal management controls involving prevention (mitigation), detection, response and recovery."
the dsp is considered to be a foundational document with the departmental security risk and opportunity register (dsror) considered to be an evergreen document that captures security risks and opportunities.
the basis for input into the dsror is an annual security risk and opportunities workshop held each fall.
"although a security risk and opportunities workshop was held, and results briefed to senior management, a formal dsror and accompanying work plan and formal prioritization and tracking of mitigation measures has not been developed."
this has not occurred.
"in addition to the dsror, it security risk management (itsrm) has its own more specific it security risk register that was last updated in june 2012."
it security has indicated that the register is required to be refreshed as it has not been updated on an ongoing basis.
it is not known at the time of the audit how these it risks will be reflected in the dsror and ultimately the dsp.
this list is not specifically connected to aafc-s it security risk register.
the five year asp was based on risk workshops conducted in 2010-11 that identified several risks.
"in january 2014, a presentation on the asp indicated the following short-term actions related to it security: implement encryption of laptops; develop a traveler-s protocol; and create business continuity plans."
"it security weaknesses outlined by cfia it security in a december 2013 -state of the union- presentation to the vice-president imit, identified items such as access control rules and processes and the integration of security requirements into the sdlc process, including ensuring appropriate sign off of risks by programs / it systems."
"a cfia specific it security risk register for the prioritization and tracking of risks has not been developed, nor has the asp been further updated subsequent to the input of the 2010-11 risk workshops."
"it is not known at the time of the audit how the asp will be updated and how it risks will be reflected in the update to the asp, including the risks now posed by the creation of ssc."
"recommendation aafc 2 / cfia 2 - the aafc adm, isb / vp, imit in collaboration with the aafc adm, cmb and cfia vp, corporate management should ensure that a formal process is developed for it security to manage a single integrated-process that considers the identification, prioritization, and tracking of it security risks for aafc and cfia, and that this process is a formal input into the overall departmental / agency security plan."
"aafc 2 management response: agree action plan: isb dg smd, in collaboration with cmb dgs, will determine and document the inputs to the integrated process to ensure all sources of it security risks are included."
action plan: management will develop a formal process for identification of risks in a centralized risk register.
"this process will identify how risks will be identified, prioritized, and tracked, and how it will be used in the newly established it security governance framework."
"this will be completed leveraging existing agency risk management processes, and will input the agency security plan."
"findings specific to aafc although there are few instances in which aafc utilizes private sector third parties as service providers for it outsourcing and hosting, there are instances in which private sector contractors play a significant role in the development and maintenance of it systems."
"the audit found that there are agreements in place, and formal processes developed for ongoing communication, between cfia and aafc related to aafc-s hosting of sap and peoplesoft for cfia."
"agency information managed by a third party remains under the control of cfia, and the agency remains accountable to ensure the information is appropriately safeguarded."
"although cfia required both parties outlined above to agree to a right to audit clause, there is not any regular or formal assessments of the security controls utilized by the third parties."
action plan: cfia will use the existing pwgsc industrial security process for third parties as required to ensure that parties are accredited to the appropriate facility security clearance (for classified information) level to manage agency information within their establishment.
"security risks are further assessed through the architecture review committee, which is currently being strengthened."
target date for completion: april 2015 the risk of third party data will be prioritized in the centralized risk register.
"target date for completion: october 2015 lead(s) responsible: vice president, imit; ed, strategic planning and management; vp, cmb management of digital information the audit expected that aafc and cfia have implemented appropriate policies, procedures and tools for the management of sensitive digital information assets, and that this information is appropriately classified and safeguarded."
findings specific to aafc the management of sensitive digital information is a high priority for aafc with extensive measures currently in place to mitigate the risks associated with using sensitive information.
"furthermore, there were a significant number of ssc employees with administrative rights and aafc was not able to validate if access by these ssc employees was appropriate."
usbs are used throughout the department; and are not tracked or controlled in any formal or consistent fashion.
"aafc has developed a defensive travel briefing: high risk travel process, and requires a mandatory security briefing for staff travelling for the department outside of the country. as part of the process, staff can request -loaner- laptops and mobile devices from isb to be used while out of the country."
audit testing confirmed that those who had travelled outside the country during the audit period had undergone the mandatory security briefing.
"however, there is not a formal process in place for aafc to easily track and monitor that -loaner- it equipment was requested and used by staff."
a major cause of this was noted as cfia-s network being accredited to only a protected a standard.
"the requirements to protect classified information are generally understood within the agency, although the agency lacks the appropriate tools to efficiently and effectively process and store classified (i.e., secret) information through electronic means."
"protected information is not being formally classified or labelled in a consistent fashion throughout the agency, for example inspection reports and certain types of surveillance data were identified as being potentially sensitive (up to protected b), and are not, as a general rule, labeled as such."
"a significant amount of information is still managed through email and network drives, through audit testing it was determined this included not only protected b information but very sensitive information related to investigations and enforcements that may be classified up to protected c. through testing it was noted there was excessive access to network file shares."
"furthermore, there were a significant number of ssc employees with administrative rights and cfia was not able to validate if access by these ssc employees was appropriate."
"for those establishments without a permanent inspector presence, imit staff noted that inspectors may plug their laptop directly into an establishment-s network, which exposes the laptop to any risks related to the establishment-s network, which may not be appropriately safeguarded."
"access has also been provided to existing government classified networks in the nhcap facility, and stand-alone processing capability is provided to those areas of high risk."
it should be noted that shared services canada is responsible for the provision of a goc secure network; however this capability is anticipated to take a few years.
"until that time, cfia will continue to use various solutions to ensure classified information is treated appropriately."
target date for completion: ongoing compliance: continue with the agency-s recently implemented security sweep program to ensure employee compliance to appropriate management of protected and classified information.
"target date for completion: ongoing lead(s) responsible: vp corporate management and cfo; executive director - asmd; ed, strategic planning and management aafc 4 - the adm, isb, in collaboration with the adm cmb, should ensure that the high risk travel process includes the formal tracking of the use of -loaner- it equipment to allow dss and itsrm to monitor adherence to this aspect of the process."
"target date for completion: january 31, 2015 cmb dg acmp and dss, in collaboration with isb dg smd and it security risk management (itsrm) will update processes to include performing monthly monitoring of utilization of -loaner- equipment and implement policy enforcement as required."
target date for completion: ongoing lead(s) responsible: vp corporate management and cfo; executive director - asmd physical security to it assets the audit expected that aafc and cfia would have implemented appropriate controls to ensure that physical access to sensitive information assets are appropriately restricted.
"although the transfer to ownership of larger data centres to ssc has taken place, aafc and cfia continues to be responsible for the actual granting of access to some of these locations."
"ssc asked for access to the server room to be further restricted, resulting in the removal of access from some it personnel; however, testing confirmed there remained excessive access."
"for an aafc regional office, the general office area was restricted by access card, however, there were no further physical access controls in place to restrict access to the server room."
"once this has been done, aafc / cfia can determine their responsibility to ensure appropriate controls are established to ensure adequate restriction of physical access to it infrastructure."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2015 isb director it client services, in collaboration with ssc, will implement procedures as defined and will monitor and report on ongoing compliance to the departmental security officer (dso) and chief information officer (cio) as appropriate on a quarterly basis."
action plan: access control protocols identify a ssc representative with appropriate level of authority to review and approve access rights to ssc server rooms in cfia space.
target date for completion: ongoing establish a key control process to ensure that appropriate restrictions are in place to control and limit access to server rooms.
target date for completion: december 2015 lead(s) responsible: vp corporate management and cfo; executive director - asmd it security risk assessment the audit expected that aafc and cfia have developed formal processes for it security risk management to ensure it systems have incorporated appropriate it security controls.
"csec published new guidance on the it security risk management process, replacing the old certification and accreditation (c&a) process with a new security assessment & authorization (sa&a) process."
the purpose of accreditation / authorization is to signify that management has authorized the system or service to operate and has accepted the residual risk of operating the system or service.
there is a gap in aafc and cfia-s it risk assessment processes given ssc has not formally acknowledged the risks related to the it infrastructure that is the responsibility of ssc.
this results in action plans developed as part of the it risk assessment process that do not include the risks and corresponding mitigation measures related to it infrastructure.
"aafc has completed the sa&a process for all critical systems, although a formal authorization to operate has not been obtained for all of these systems."
"through sample testing, the audit noted that for systems under development since the establishment of the sa&a framework, although sa&a activities such as threat and risk assessments (tras) and vulnerability assessments (vas) have been conducted, there has not been a formal follow-up on the mitigation of the risks identified."
"furthermore, there was no documentation that could be provided to demonstrate that systems are taking a controls-based approach for it security."
"for instance, there was no evidence of a -catalogue- of security controls based on the system-s security requirements that was then formally traced through a security requirements traceability matrix to the implemented controls that was assessed through the tra, and subsequently could be tested if applicable. there is not a formal continuous monitoring and testing strategy in place, current monitoring consists of reviewing significant changes to systems for additional risks, which may require a formal assessment through an updated tra."
"a documented it risk assessment does not exist within cfia, nor has such a process been incorporated into the sdlc."
it security has not been formally consulted on it projects being undertaken for the operations branch.
risks identified in tras are often not formally mitigated or followed-up.
"furthermore, there was no documentation that could be provided to demonstrate that systems are taking a controls-based approach for it security."
"for instance, there was no evidence of a -catalogue- of security controls based on the system-s security requirements that was then formally traced through a security requirements traceability matrix to the implemented controls that was assessed through the tra, and subsequently could be tested if applicable. there is not a formal continuous monitoring and testing strategy in place."
"target date for completion: march 31, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, dg smd; ssc dg, client relationships & business intake aafc 7 - the adm, isb should ensure that as part of the sa&a process, all new systems undertake a more formal security controls-based approach, and that risk identified during the initial assessment activities (i.e. tra and va) are followed up in a timely manner, prior to system -go live-, furthermore a more formal and comprehensive approach for the continuous monitoring of it security risks and controls is developed."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2015 isb dg smd will update the departmental im/it portfolio management framework, templates, checklist and change control processes to ensure that the project managers and project directors are aware that assessment activities, including formal it security authorization to ensure risks identified during the initial assessment phase are mitigated and formal authorization to operate are completed prior to system -go live-."
"target date for completion: june 30, 2015 isb dg smd will develop and implement a comprehensive and risk-based approach for continuous monitoring of it security risks and controls throughout the lifecycle of systems."
"target date for completion: july 31, 2015 lead(s) responsible: adm isb, dg smd cfia 7 - the vice-president imit should ensure that as a formal it risk assessment process is established within the agency and that all new systems undertake a more formal security controls-based approach that risks identified during assessment activities (i.e. tra and va) are followed-up in a timely manner, and a continuous monitoring strategy is developed."
action plan: management will procure a senior consultant to provide recommendations toward creating the risk assessment approach based upon controls.
all new systems are currently required to complete a threat risk assessment.
"target date for completion: april 2015 from this assessment, management will create a risk assessment program, where risks identified during assessment activities will be fed into the centralized risk register for prioritization and assignment."
"target date for completion: april 2016 a continuous monitoring strategy will be developed in conjunction with the risk assessment program, of which the centralized risk register will be a major contributing factor."
target date for completion: april 2016 a strategy to address and re-evaluate existing systems will be developed as part of the risk assessment program.
"target date for completion: april 2016 lead(s) responsible: vice president, imit; ed, strategic planning and management logical access controls the audit expected that aafc and cfia have ensured that logical access to systems has been appropriately restricted to authorized users."
"findings specific to aafc at aafc, the employee separation form is intended to be used throughout the department to begin the termination process, although it was noted that regions often have their own form or may process a termination without a form."
"once the separation form is completed by the terminated employee-s manager and submitted, it is entered as a ticket into aafc-s ticketing system (and attached to the ticket), which generates additional tickets to inform the appropriate individuals to take specific action, such as disabling network access."
"audit testing noted that the active directory (ad) account that provides access to the network was not disabled for some departed employees; in addition, many did not have a form on file. although aafc is responsible for disabling the network accounts of -normal- end users, for those with administrative privileges to the network, the request to disable the account must be sent from aafc to ssc."
"a formal process exists for the granting of user access to the it systems; however, through audit testing a sample of new and modified user accounts, it was noted that exceptions were noted in that evidence that the formal process was followed was not on file."
"through a review of privileged access to the it systems, the audit team concluded that privileged access was appropriate for two out of the three systems audited; however, access for users with the highest level of privilege in the system was not appropriate, this was based on either the user not having the appropriate security clearance or that they had transferred to another function."
"shared privileged accounts were identified in each it system tested, although access to these shared accounts were appropriately restricted, there were no formal procedures to further control (e.g. password changes) or monitor the access and use of these accounts."
none of the systems had formal controls established to ensure an appropriate segregation of duties between security administration and the development and deployment of changes to the system.
"findings specific to cfia the departure from agency form is intended to be used throughout the agency to begin the termination process, although it was noted that regions often have their own form or may process a termination without a form."
"testing noted that the active directory (ad) account was not disabled for some departed employees, and many did not have a form on file. although cfia is responsible for disabling the network accounts of -normal- end users, for those with administrative privileges to the network, the request to disable the account must be sent from cfia to ssc."
"although one of the other systems does have password requirements, these were found to not be consistent with leading practice."
"through audit testing, exceptions were noted in that evidence was not on file that formal approval was given."
"through a review of privileged access to the applications, the audit team concluded that for three applications, some users with privileged accounts did not require this level of access."
"shared privileged accounts were identified in each application, although access to these shared accounts were appropriately restricted, there were no formal procedures to further control (e.g. password changes) or monitor the access and use of these accounts."
"it was noted that of the four it systems selected for audit testing, all but one did not have formal controls established to ensure an appropriate segregation of duties between security administration and the development and deployment of changes to the system."
"target date for completion: april 2015 lead(s) responsible: vp, human resources aafc 9 / cfia 9 - the adm, isb / vp, imit in collaboration with the aafc adm, cmb and cfia vp, corporate management should ensure that standards for application logical access controls are reviewed and enforced, and adherence to these is reviewed through aafc / cfia-s it security risk management processes."
"this includes organizational-wide requirements for the granting and reviewing of user access, management of privileged accounts, and the appropriate segregation of duties."
"aafc 9 management response: agree action plan: isb dg smd, in collaboration with the isb dg ims, isb dg add, isb director it client service and cmb dg amcp will complete a review of application logical access standards and current practices update the standards to ensure appropriate account management processes including segregation of duties and, promote standards including training and communications to managers and staff."
"target date for completion: september 30, 2015 isb dg smd will identify the specific security controls required for applications based on the standard updated in #9.1 and ensure that these controls are included in the baseline security controls for all applications moving forward."
"completion of this is highly dependent upon securing appropriate funding for this initiative, and the successful progress of other agency initiatives, such as ramp."
a governance structure for it security has been established and supported through an appropriate it security framework.
"line of enquiry 2: a formal process for the management of sensitive information assets exists and is consistently implemented to ensure the appropriate classification, use, and management of sensitive digital information."
"a formal process for the management of sensitive digital information assets exists and is consistently implemented to ensure the appropriate classification, use, and management of sensitive digital information."
"formal policies and procedures have been developed, and appropriate tools provided, related to the management of sensitive digital information assets."
physical security processes are in place and implemented to ensure that physical access to sensitive information assets are appropriately restricted.

there is an effective control framework in place to govern major programs that utilize personal information management at the public service commission.
there is an effective control framework in place to govern major programs that utilize personal information management at the public service commission.finding 1: management control framework over the protection of personal information we examined the overall management control framework over personal information management within the public service commission (psc) to determine whether employees are aware of and were effectively carrying out their roles and responsibilities.
"lastly, we examined whether there were effective policies and processes in place to govern personal information management at the psc."
"the psc collects, manages and stores personal information in all branches and levels of the organization and therefore personal information management is both an individual and organizational responsibility."
policies and processes need to be well-defined and communicated to provide employees with the tools for effective personal information management.
"personal information management expectations are defined in the privacy management framework at the psc, personal information policies, processes and practices are defined in a privacy management framework (pmf)."
"the pmf, implemented in 2011, is aligned with treasury board policies and is posted on the internal psc web site."
the degree to which managers are aware of the information available in the pmf varies from branch to branch.
this is mainly due to the fact that training provided by the access to information and privacy (atip) office covers certain parts of the privacy act but contains limited information on the pmf and is not mandatory.
well-communicated common practices help management develop a culture of responsibility and accountability for personal information at all levels of the organization.
"roles and responsibilities for personal information management are defined in the privacy management framework according to the pmf, personal information at the psc is managed primarily at the branch level."
the atip office plays a central consultative role that includes providing guidance and advice and developing policies.
the atip office is also responsible for monitoring the psc-s compliance with the privacy act.
governance over personal information is the responsibility of senior management.
"review of the results of privacy impact assessments (pia) and associated action plans is the responsibility of senior management committees, including the executive management committee and the information management and information technology committee (im/itc)."
the information technology services directorate (itsd) plays an important role in managing personal information.
"they are responsible for advising clients on the implementation of security measures, managing the networks and systems where information is stored and carrying out responsibilities on im through the information management office (imo)."
"as required by tb policy, pias have been mandatory for all new or modified programs that have utilized personal information since 2002."
the introduction of the pmf in 2011 has made this process more visible.
the psc has substantially completed pias for its major systems and programs.
"this includes the analytical environment in the audit and data services branch, the public service resourcing system (psrs) in the staffing and assessment services branch and the priority information management system (pims) in the policy branch."
pia action plans for these systems are in various stages of implementation.
recommendations: the psc atip office should develop and deliver mandatory training on the pmf.
"we assessed whether the collection of personal information was authorized and consented to, as well as used and disclosed in accordance with authorities."
"we examined whether safeguards were in place to protect personal information and if there were processes to ensure the accuracy of, and access to, personal information."
individuals have a right to know how and when their personal information will be collected and used so that they can make informed decisions prior to providing it to organizations.
"once this information is collected, there is a duty to ensure that this information is accurate, protected against unauthorized access and used only as intended."
"disclosure and openness notification and consent for collection of personal information is obtained prior to the collection of personal information, the organization must disclose the reasons for collection and use of the information and receive consent."
this is typically done through various notification forms that are made available to individuals when their personal data is collected.
"in all systems reviewed, the necessary notification is provided and consent is obtained prior to the collection of personal information."
the initiative for creating and maintaining notice and consent forms is managed at the branch level.
"the atip office, in its consultative capacity, has created a template to aid in the development of these forms, and reviews notices and consent forms, upon request."
"personal information banks are updated and well-documented the psc-s info source chapter, that contains the descriptions of the psc-s personal information holdings, is posted on the external web site and is the primary means of disclosing to the public the nature of the collection of personal information and ensuring that the psc respects the privacy act-s principle of openness."
this information is updated and provided to tbs annually.
"collection, use and disclosure of personal information personal information is collected under authority granted by the privacy act the privacy act, the public service employment act and the inquiries act (investigations branch) give the psc the authority to collect data for the fulfillment of its mandate."
all personal information collected and used by the psc is referenced under this authority.
"there are opportunities to limit the personal information received and used by the public service commission each month, the itsd receives the central index (ci) file from public works and government services canada."
"this file contains personal information of all current and former federal government employees, including social insurance numbers and personal record identifiers, and is used by the psc for research and analysis."
not all of the personal information in the ci file is needed by the psc.
access to personal information in the priority information management system is given at the group level human resource (hr) advisors in the federal public service are provided access to the priority information management system (pims) and can access the personal information of all individuals who have a priority entitlement.
most hr advisors only need to access information on individuals in their area of responsibility.
this is due to the design of the system that gives group-level access.
"internal information sharing agreements are in progress personal information can be shared internally between branches or externally between other federal, provincial, municipal or international governments when an information sharing agreement is in place, where there is consistent use and where disclosure to persons to whom the information belongs has taken place."
these agreements outline the terms and conditions under which personal information is shared between the parties.
"externally, personal information shared with other federal government departments is governed by either a memorandum of understanding or a usage agreement with individual employees of other government organizations for all systems we reviewed."
safeguarding of personal information system-level access controls to personal information are in place personal information can be safeguarded against unauthorized access by preventative controls such as limiting physical or electronic access and/or detective controls such as reviewing who accessed or modified systems and records.
access to systems is generally well-controlled at the psc.
access lists are being maintained and unique passwords are regularly updated.
an audit trail or log of transactions once a user has access is available on most systems.
physical access to facilities was outside the scope of this audit.
the psc is working to resolve this issue.
required security levels for employees who work with personal information have not been assessed most personal information at the psc is classified as protected a or protected b. employees who work with this personal information must be cleared with a minimum enhanced reliability security clearance.
"some employees at the psc are required to work with multiple records of personal information, sensitive personal records and/or personal information on individuals outside of the psc."
"any of these situations could impact the security classification level of the information and, therefore, the security requirements of employees who access this information."
"this includes mobile telephones, usb storage keys and laptops."
"in these cases, all electronic storage devices need to be encrypted."
all of the psc-s mobile phones and laptops are encrypted.
"in the policy branch (pb), political activity forms can arrive via an unsecure fax machine rather than via a password-protected copier machine that preserves confidentiality."
"while access is limited to employees only, any dedicated electronic devices that can potentially receive personal information should have safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized disclosure."
accuracy and access individuals can access their files to verify the accuracy of personal information the majority of personal information collected by the psc is provided by individuals through job applications and political candidacy requests.
"therefore, the responsibility of the accuracy of the information rests on the individual."
the psc-s role is to provide controlled access to systems and conduct behind-the scenes-verification.
access is controlled and information is periodically verified for all systems tested.
"disposition and retention most electronic information is kept indefinitely retention and disposition schedules for all personal information, whether electronic or paper, are the responsibility of library and archives canada (lac)."
this option may be considered for holdings that are of value for research purposes only.
"recommendations: the audit and data services branch, in conjunction with the information technology services directorate (itsd), should limit the receipt of personal information in the ci file to those records and fields required to carry out their work."
"the pb, in conjunction with the itsd, should limit access to personal information in the pims system to a need-to-know basis."
"the itsd should assess security levels for the ci file, deploy secure usb keys and provide secure faxes to areas that receive and utilize personal information."
we assessed the processes that were in place to monitor personal information management practices at the psc.
"we also examined whether the policies and processes of the psc were updated on a regular basis, in accordance with federal government requirements."
"lastly, we examined privacy breach practices at the psc and what mechanisms were in place to identify, report and guard against future occurrences."
effective management of privacy breaches addresses potential gaps and provides for continuous improvement of psc personal information management practices.
overall monitoring and reporting processes need to be strengthened there are some processes in place to monitor and report to senior management on the status of personal information management practices at the psc.
senior managers sign off on personal information banks and ensure that pias are conducted to cover new personal information holdings and existing holdings that have substantially changed.
information on privacy management practices is provided to senior management in the atip annual report.
there are several areas that need to be strengthened.
follow-up on pias and associated action plans are reported on by the atip office every two years.
several action plans are at various stages of completion.
completed pias and action plans are sent to the office of the privacy commissioner and the tbs for feedback and consultation and are monitored by the atip office.
"in addition, there is no comprehensive report/inventory of all personal information holdings and their degree of compliance with the requirements of the pmf and the tb privacy directive, which would give management a tool to monitor the state of personal information management in the psc."
the atip office has limited visibility in the psc-s integrated business plan.
"given the nature of the psc-s business, increased focus and attention to privacy information management would help management identify these monitoring and reporting gaps."
data accuracy is being monitored branches are monitoring personal information collected for accuracy through the review of data entered into on-line templates.
"in addition, when a collection process requires several steps, it is common practice to use checklists and routing slips to ensure that the process is completed as required."
there is monitoring and reporting of privacy breaches privacy breaches at the psc are rare.
most breaches come to the attention of the atip office through complaints by the person concerned about the release of details of personal information.
the majority of complaints are unfounded.
psc branches have the responsibility to report breaches to the atip office.
they can also be reported to the atip office via a complaint to the privacy commissioner.
all breaches are reported to the office of the privacy commissioner.
recommendation: the psc atip office should strengthen monitoring and reporting practices and ensure that activities from privacy action plans are included in the psc-s planning processes.
we also assessed the adequacy of risk management practices over personal information.
risks to personal information management need to be understood so that management can make informed decisions over the levels of control needed within their areas.
this lack of awareness has been improved by the development of branch-specific procedures.
each branch is responsible for managing the risks to personal information by defining expectations for their staff and putting in place the appropriate levels of control to mitigate the risks.
"all major programs have undertaken a privacy impact assessment as stated in the pmf, the pia is a process for identifying, assessing and mitigating privacy risks."
"a pia identifies potential privacy issues, forecasts impacts and identifies strategies and actions to eliminate or reduce privacy risks."
"privacy impact assessments have not been undertaken for legacy systems and smaller programs there are a number of legacy systems and processes that collect personal information that have not undergone a pia, as outlined in appendix b. although the directive on privacy impact assessment puts the emphasis on new and substantially changed programs, without the completion of these assessments, including the development of action plans, management cannot have assurance that privacy risks in these areas have been identified and effectively mitigated."
all psc branches should determine whether a pia is needed for legacy systems and processes that utilize personal information. finding 2: internal controls over the management of personal information most internal controls over personal information management are in place; there are opportunities to further reduce privacy risks.
most internal controls over personal information management are in place; there are opportunities to further reduce privacy risks.
we also examined whether personal information is disposed of when it is no longer of value so as to reduce privacy risks and if the psc discloses the rationale for why it collects this information.
records that are collected and not needed for business purposes create additional risks to the organization.
limiting the amount of information received and used by the psc reduces the risk of potential privacy breaches.
personal information should be shared on a need-to-know basis to reduce the risk of privacy breaches.
internal information sharing agreements between branches are not in place for all processes but have been identified as an action in some pias that were reviewed.
"the public service commission network is not certified to handle certain personal information certain personal information is considered protected b, based on the federal government-s classification system."
the psc-s network has not been certified protected b. this was noted in the recent information management audit.
most controls over mobile electronic devices are in place one of the biggest risks to privacy breaches is the loss of electronic devices that contain personal information.
"to prevent this risk, personal information should be stored on the network instead of locally on electronic devices."
the psc has some encrypted usb keys but has not deployed them in all branches.
this risk is somewhat mitigated due to the fact that there is a good general awareness of the need to store information using secure keys but could be strengthened through additional training.
"most paper documents at the psc are retained and disposed in accordance with lac schedules; however, most personal information in electronic format is stored indefinitely."
"there are several outstanding issues that need to be resolved, including whether electronic records: have historic value, in which case indefinite storage is the correct solution; are so unique that no corresponding lac schedule exists, in which case one needs to be developed; and have been transferred to rdims and the retention period has not been identified."
anonymizing the documents (removing personal identifiers) rather than disposition is another option that can be used to reduce the risks associated with long-term storage of electronic data.
all psc branches should review their retention processes and develop schedules for disposition or anonymization of personal information. finding 3: monitoring of personal information management practices improvement to monitoring practices will provide senior management with a better understanding of risks and controls.
improvement to monitoring practices will provide senior management with a better understanding of risks and controls.
monitoring of practices ensures managers are held accountable for their management of personal information and gives senior management assurance that risks are mitigated.
changes to federal government policies and practices need to be monitored to help the psc address emerging risks and issues.
"when they are not finalized and approved, this monitoring and feedback cannot occur."
"without an effective monitoring process, senior management cannot ensure that branches have taken the necessary steps to manage privacy risks."
founded complaints are followed up by the atip office to reduce the risk of future occurrences.

"in support of our conclusion we noted adequate compliance for the following: faa section 32, fund commitment approval - 59/61 (97%) faa section 41, delegated contracting authority - 48/55 (87%) faa section 34 performance certification approval - 72/74 (97%) approval of amendments - 8/10 (80%) continuing efforts to implement a secure network and the introduction of new delegated authority management tools are expected to provide increased assurance that only properly trained and delegated authorities enter into contracts on nrc-s behalf."
an effective management control framework for procurement and contracting includes clear procedures and guidelines over the authorization and award of contracts supporting transparency and stewardship over public funds.
"the awarding of construction, goods and service contracts must stand the scrutiny of oversight bodies and the canadian public to demonstrate value for money and enhance fairness and competition."
"the audit examined interim controls in place for compliance with fund commitment, performance certification and contracting authority requirements as set out in the federal administration act, sections 32, 34, and 41 respectively."
payments without reference to a purchase order follow the same approval authorities except for faa section 41 contracting authority and may include additional manual scrutiny by nrc processing and monitoring functions.
the budget holder had omitted signing the requisition when providing the necessary documentation for processing.
the budget holder did have the necessary signing authority for the requisition.
"as part of a sample of 25 payments made without reference to a purchase order, we noted one instance where the budget holder lacked delegated financial authorities commensurate with their role as an -acting director-."
"of the seven instances, three were related to a single contracting officer who was later delegated increased authorities as part of their promotion."
"in one of the cases for the promoted contracting officer, the contract was signed by another procurement officer with the proper delegated authorities after the fact."
four of seven cases occurred in regional offices.
payment of goods and services section 34 of the financial administration act requires that payment for goods and services not be made without a delegated authority of the crown certifying that the goods and or services have been received and that the payment is eligible under the terms and conditions of the contract.
"in 72 of 74 invoices, we noted that the invoice had been reviewed and was approved by an individual with the proper delegated authority."
"of the two instances of section 34 non-compliance, one instance related to an individual who lacked signing authority but was part of the project team."
we identified instances where purchase order invoices were paid more than once but internal monitoring processes identified and subsequently corrected the error.
finance branch currently maintains invoices sequentially and not in the contracting file.
there are opportunities to improve records management by organizing invoices by purchase order reference to reduce the likelihood of duplicate payments.
"management informed us that once nrc introduces a secure environment, invoices will be digitized eliminating the need for the current paper-based records management structure."
"in regards to payments without reference to a purchase order, we noted that coding practices were less consistent than purchase order procurements."
we noted two instances where the nrc contracting authority exceeded their contracting values; both instances were for regionally managed contracts where delegated authorities in the post-cyber intrusion environment were less clear.
in both instances the expenditure was requisitioned and certified for payment by an approved delegated budget holder.
"instead, aspm was able to obtain alternative means to access the government of canada network allowing access to procurement tools available through pwgsc until secure network resources were made available beginning in january 2015."
"in our sample of 25, we noted three instances where a payment without reference was used in lieu of a purchase order."
"in two instances, the payments without reference to a purchase order were made for construction related services which require purchase orders; one of them was identified by nrc accounts payable as part of regular monitoring activities."
"in another instance, the payment without reference was made due to an error in processing of a related purchase order."
"while the vendor was at fault, a delegated nrc authority approved the expenditure."
incorrect commodity type coding hinders the ability to track and report on procurement activities and types to central agencies in support of more competitive contracts.
we noted that aspm has already moved to fix the coding issues as part of their regular monitoring activities.
we also identified instances of duplicate contracts where procurements were initiated for the same good or service.
"in 2 of 24 samples reviewed, we identified evidence of potential appearance of contracting splitting whereby two or more separate contracts were awarded for the same, similar or related procurements thereby avoiding nrc-s sole source contracting limits."
"in one instance, the requestor noted that the procurement was time sensitive in support of potentially life-saving outcomes but documentation on file was lacking to establish the use of section 6 of the government contracting regulations where the -need is one of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest-."
"in the second instance, a quote was processed as two separate contracts to meet nrc-s sole source contract limits."
"in 1 of 24 samples, we identified a sample set of three contracts that were awarded to perform similar work at different locations."
"contract splitting circumvents established controls and limits over sole source contracting, circumvents government of canada, tb and nrc approval processes, and reduces competition and transparency."
"we noted that following the cyber-intrusion, aspm created a centralized procurement processing centre with select staff processing on behalf of the entire organization regardless of commodity type."
the interim process reduced visibility over procurement requests hindering frontline procurement staff in the identification of potential contract splitting activities by budget holders and requestors.
"in january 2015, nrc provided secure workstations to procurement staff allowing contracting officers to return to commodity based specialization which is expected to increase monitoring and reduce instances of contract splitting."
"procurement transparency supporting government transparency, contracts over $10k in value, including amendments, are posted to nrc-s extranet and are available for public viewing."
"in one instance, we could not identify the contract award listing on nrc-s proactive disclosure page."
"contracting security considerations due to the cyber-intrusion, nrc instituted a security awareness program and additional security measures to safeguard assets, information and personnel."
budget holders and procurement requestors are required to define any and all security requirements related to their contract requirements.
nrc revised security practices following the cyber-intrusion by implementing new physical security safeguards and procedures and communicating them across the organization.
"as of april 2015, nrc has reintroduced electronic purchase requisitions which include a template security requirements box to standardize information collection."
"authorization assessment overall, we found that interim procurement authorization controls were adequate to demonstrate adherence to treasury board commitment, funding approval and contracting requirements."
"proper fund commitment according to section 32 of the financial administration act, financial agreements or arrangements cannot be entered into without sufficient funds available to settle related obligations."
"in general, we found that nrc had defined an interim delegation of authority system to ensure proper commitment of funding, awarding of contracts, and certification for performance of contract requirements."
"in 51 applicable contracts reviewed, we noted one instance where funding was not properly secured and approved before the contract was awarded."
we found that nrc-s online delegated authority system is not fully up-to-date with gaps in authorities for individuals both in acting as well as continuing capacities.
the lack of an updated delegated authority matrix to define roles and contracting value limits hinders contract approvals and dilutes the strength of clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
"entering into contracts in 55 contracts reviewed for appropriate section 41 authority, delegated authority to enter into contracts on nrc-s behalf, we found seven instances where the contracting authority exceeded their contracting limits."
in two instances the procurement officer exceeded their delegated authority for contracting dollar limits and in the remaining instances the procurement officer did not use the appropriate procurement vehicle to acquire services on nrc-s behalf.
"in general, we found that nrc remained in compliance with section 34 of the faa."
"in the second instance, insufficient documentation was on file to demonstrate proper sign-off and sign-off was provided prior to certification that all goods / services had been received."
expense coding we found financial coding to be adequate with the majority of purchase orders being coded to the correct expense accounts.
"consistently, we found payments without reference being coded to diverse expense accounts precluding proper classification of expenditures for analyses such as spending on safety and health."
amendments amendments were found to have been adequately authorized and justified as demonstrated in file documentation.
"in 8 of 10 instances where amendments were used, we identified adequate documentation to justify the amendment, to demonstrate that the contractor ratified the amendment, and that amendments were approved by an nrc delegated authority with sufficient cumulative authority."
"contract management assessment overall, we found that interim procurement controls were sufficient to demonstrate appropriate use of procurement tools and transparency in procurement and contracting activities."
in support of our conclusion we noted the following: appropriate use of procurement tools - 78/80 (98%) evidence of potential contract splitting - 2/24 (8%) disclosure of awarded contracts - 23/24 (96%) documentation on file to demonstrate security requirements - 30/42 (71%) the full implementation of nrc-s new secure electronic working environment is expected to re-enable oversight capabilities from nrc-s previous workflow arrangements.
effective oversight of the procurement process includes the use of mandated government of canada standing offers where appropriate and the use of the most effective procurement tools while maintaining compliance with the spirit of government of canada contracting rules and regulations.
the audit examined interim controls for the awarding of contracts including the use of appropriate procurement tools such as use of mandatory standing offers and adequate justification for sole source contracts.
we noted that the decentralized structure of aspm-s procurement function required that national capital region (ncr) resources process contracts and payments from october 2014 when nrc re-initialized its financial and material management system until regional employees received secure network access and workstations beginning in january 2015. appropriate use of procurement tools we noted that nrc had not applied for any exemptions from public works or treasury board to reduce restrictions on the use of mandatory standing offers.
"in general, we found that nrc purchased goods and services according to established guidelines and used standing offers where applicable and available."
"in general, we found that payments without reference to a purchase order were managed according to established guidelines."
we did not find evidence that payments without reference were used to circumvent the procurement process.
"we noted in 18 of 25 payments without reference, the use of an acquisition card may have been more appropriate in terms of administration and processing time."
"through data analytics, we noted instances of incorrectly coded procurements based on commodity types."
"in all identified cases, payments had not been processed and aspm cancelled duplicate procurements as they were identified."
"the contracts had different statements of work but did not respect the spirit of the tb contracting policy with regard to -clear outputs or performance requirements-, contributing to the appearance of contract splitting."
"we found that while the nrc contract review committee (crc) has not met regularly since the cyber-intrusion, the head of procurement and contracting has undertaken review sessions to assess contracts that fall under crc oversight requirements."
"we found that in 24 eligible cases, 23 disclosures were up-to-date and reflected all amendments on file according to the tb guidelines on the proactive disclosure of contracts."
"we noted that the reversion to manual purchase requisitions resulted in inconsistent information being obtained from budget holders and procurement requestors, especially in relation to security requirements."
"within one geographical region using its own paper-based purchase requisitions, we noted that the requisition did not prompt requestors to identify security requirements."
"in 12 of 42 (29%) instances, either the purchase requisition was not completed properly to define security requirements or the documentation was incomplete or not on file to demonstrate that all necessary security requirements had been completed."
"while the documentation was not always complete or available, nrc had mitigating controls to protect its staff, information and assets."
"in support of our conclusion, we noted adequate compliance for the following: use of standard agreements - 40/40 (100%) demonstration of recipient eligibility for program funding - 40/40 (100%) commitment and coding of funding - 40/40 (100%) contracting authority to award contribution agreements - 40/40 (100%) proactive disclosure of applicable awarded contributions - 22/22 (100%) an effective transfer payments control framework includes clearly defined standards and procedures to assess and demonstrate the eligibility and alignment of contributions to program objectives."
awarding of contributions must be transparent and properly documented to maintain public trust and adequately demonstrate adherence to program terms and conditions.
the audit examined the interim controls put in place to support due diligence and transparency in the assessment of project proposals and the awarding of contributions.
due diligence assessment templates contained the necessary fields to capture the information required for a delegated contracting authority to approve a contribution proposal in a transparent manner.
"effective april 1, 2015, irap updated all contribution agreement templates and tools which are available through the irap intranet and is accessible to all irap staff."
it is important that files contain complete information to ensure that all required and necessary documentation is available to support the management of ongoing contributions and to protect the integrity and transparency of the program.
"as of may 2015, we noted that irap has defined a records management strategy to migrate post-cyber-intrusion recipient files into nrc-s secure network."
providing a brief description in the interim template -decision log- increases transparency of the award process as outlined by the irap field manual.
"proactive disclosure as part of the government of canada-s management improvement agenda, all contribution agreements over $25k under irap and irap managed programs are disclosed on nrc-s external website."
"within our sample of due diligence files, all 22 applicable agreements over $25k were adequately disclosed on nrc-s external website with the most up-to-date awarded values and project end dates."
"in support of our conclusion, we noted adequate compliance for the following: review and approval of contribution claims - 84/85 (99%) performance of post-payment validations on applicable first claims - 23/24 (96%) we noted payment issues resulting from mathematical errors that do not materially impact the overall conclusion of this audit criterion."
"as well, we noted one instance where a claim was paid out prior to the complete draw down of an applicable advance payment which increases the likelihood of an overpayment and need to recover funds."
efforts are ongoing as of april 2015 to return to steady-state business processes which are expected to rectify the issues identified.
the audit examined the interim controls put in place to oversee contribution agreement management including monitoring of project activities and proper approval of contribution claims.
"claim process as part of business continuity measures, irap implemented a centralized claims management process following the re-initialization of nrc-s financial management system in october 2014."
all claims were processed centrally in the national capital region until a secure network was set-up and secure laptops were made available to regional staff beginning in january 2015.
"we noted that irap reverted to the paper-based management system that was discontinued when sonar, irap-s contribution management system, was upgraded in fy2013."
interim tools and templates for claims management and amendments have been put in place and are available through irap-s intranet.
"in general, paper-based claims were found to have been adequately completed, reviewed and approved."
"within our sample of 85 claims, we noted eight instances where claim calculations were incorrect stemming from mathematical errors in calculating claimed salary costs."
"errors were immaterial, ranging from between 0.31% to less than 0.01% of the total value of the contribution agreement where the contribution agreements in question ranged from $20k to $350k in value."
"as well, recipients are required to complete a final report that requires disclosure of other government funding received during the life of the contribution agreement."
"within a sample of 53 claims processed between august and november 2014, we noted that the median processing time from recipient approval to payment release from nrc-s financial system was 12 business days while the average time was 16 business days."
"within our sample, the longest period between recipient claim approval and the date nrc had payment ready for release was 65 business days."
irap has defined a service standard of payment issuance within 35 business days of receiving all properly completed and required documentation.
"in our review, only 5 of the 53 claims processed between august and november 2014 exceeded 35 business days."
"of the five cases, four were related to claims made within the first two months of the cyber-intrusion when interim operating environment controls were being introduced."
irap was generally able to process claims and continue supporting recipients despite the shutdown of nrc-s it network.
"post-payment validation as part of irap-s project monitoring activities, post payment validations (ppv)s are undertaken to verify that recipients understand the claiming process, are keeping adequate records of costs incurred, and are settling their liabilities according to the terms and conditions of their contribution agreements."
contribution eligibility assessment overall we found that interim controls were effective in supporting contribution agreement due diligence in the award of irap contribution agreements.
contributions awarded post cyber-intrusion adhered to established funding requirements and sufficient documentation was available to demonstrate transparency and due process in the review of project proposals.
"while some issues were identified in relation to records management, use of templates, and consistent documentation of justification for project approvals, they did not materially impact our overall conclusion for this audit criterion."
"in one instance, we noted that the special condition requirements defined in an interim template was not transferred into the contribution agreement formally approved by nrc and ratified by the recipient."
special conditions are put in place to increase the level of monitoring and oversight of projects based on risk factors determined by the industrial technology advisor (ita) and or contracting authority.
the lack of completely defined special conditions increases project risk and reduces the effectiveness of monitoring and oversight.
we also noted instances where the approved contribution agreement had differing template pages.
"while we did not identify any issues with agreements containing pages from differing templates, it is important that irap maintain the integrity of its agreement templates to ensure that awarded contributions contain the most up-to-date terms and conditions and reflect the most up-to-date requirements for all programs managed under the irap umbrella."
"across a sample of 40 contribution agreements, we found that proposal reviews and assessments generally contained adequate depth and detail of the recipient-s business and its plans and strategies; project market opportunities; project technical details; and anticipated project benefits to canada."
"project coding in 40 contribution agreements reviewed, we found that all were coded to the correct financial accounts and work-breakdown structures (wbs) as defined in nrc-s financial and project management system to support reporting integrity."
"contribution agreement approvals in 40 contribution agreements, we found that all had the required approvals by a nrc delegated contracting authority and all the agreements were sufficiently supported by ita technological and business assessments."
contribution management assessment overall we found that interim controls for contribution claim management were adequate to demonstrate stewardship over taxpayer funds.
"the current paper-heavy system, while not sustainable over the long-term, is sufficient to manage the recipient claiming process."
"an effective management control framework for transfer payments includes clearly defined procedures for management and oversight of contribution agreements, risk-based monitoring activities, clearly defined and properly segregated duties, and a structured claim verification process."
claim review and approval we found adequate faa section 34 performance certification approval for all 85 claims reviewed.
the total value of the over-claim did not exceed $100.00 on an agreement totalling $140k.
"with regard to claims under the canada accelerator and incubator program, we noted that in one instance, an advance payment was provided to the recipient and a subsequent advance payment was made before the recipient had provided sufficient claims to off-set the advance payment."
"within our sample of claims, we identified 24 first claims that required ppv activities and only one post-payment validation that had not been completed."
"travel assessment overall, controls over travel expenditures remained effective in the interim operating environment (ioe)."
"the audit population for the period was 3,803 staff travel claims totalling $4,344,211 and 218 non-staff travel claims totalling $238,802."
"below we provide more details on the criteria which were not fully compliant: financial administrative act (faa) sec. 32 and 34, and vp approval."
"in addition, we also provided further details on travel advances and individual travel cards balances."
"the pre-approval for one of the non-staff travel claims was partially completed as the claim was signed, but not dated and was missing the budgeted costs."
the remaining two non-staff travel claims had completed pre-approvals which were signed after the travel date.
"the travel pre-approvals for all three non-staff travel claims were prepared before the ioe, and only the reimbursements were processed after the cyber-intrusion."
"faa sec. 34: performance certification the faa requires that the performance certification be approved, to ensure the work or service is completed, before the payment is issued."
the budget holder commitment pre-approval (sec. 32 of the faa) was correctly authorized by the budget holder and the direct supervisor of the traveller.
the performance certification approval should have been signed by the budget holder for the project instead of the direct supervisor of the employee.
the commitment authority has to be signed by the budget holder and the vice president (vp) approval for expenditure authority is required to issue a travel authorization number (tan) for air and train travel.
the vp approval is issued through the travel authority request approval workflow (taraw) database.
staff travelers require a tan to complete the travel bookings through the approved travel agency.
non-staff travelers are only required to use the travel agency if the nrc is paying for the air or rail travel directly with the nrc corporate card.
the non-staff traveler could receive vp approval for air or rail travel through the taraw database or by a direct signature on the pre-approval form.
if they use the travel agency the non-staff travel would be issued a tan as normally and a temporary personal travel identification number (tin).
the ioe process limited the vp approval requirement to international travel and conference travel only.
this process was introduced as the taraw database which is used to obtain vp approval electronically was off line during the ioe and it would have been an administrative burden to obtain manual vp approval for each case.
central travel office had a list of available tan-s to issue throughout the ioe period when the taraw database was unavailable.
"this situation explains why it was possible to have a compliance rate of 100 percent under the criterion of tan when required (i.e. air and train travel) without having vp approval. from our sample of 55 travel claims, 41 should have had a vp approval. from those 41, 28 were initiated before the cyber intrusion and 13 after the cyber intrusion during the ioe period."
the audit findings for the vp approval during the ioe period were a temporary issue as the taraw database had been restored and used by january 2015.
the other pre-approval issues were not systematic and the required procedures have been reviewed and discussed with the central travel office (cto).
"for domestic claims of staff, the threshold is $3,500, and $2,500 for non-staff."
"for the travel claims above these thresholds, a verification of receipts is performed by the cto staff."
"there was one staff claim where the lunch allowance was requested, even though lunches were provided by the conference organizers."
the remaining three issues (two staff and one non-staff) were for expenses included on a hotel invoice which would normally be covered by the traveller-s per diem and incidental daily rate.
"these ineligible expenses were not removed from the hotel invoice and were refunded to the traveller as part of the accommodation expense, resulting in an overpayment to the traveller."
"note that these four travel claims were all below $3,500."
duplicate payment there was one claim for which a duplicate payment was issued to the traveller due to a copy of the original travel claim which was re-submitted to the cto.
the travel claim was refunded despite the fact that the invoices were not original invoices.
"the auditor notified cto to seek reimbursement, which was received during the audit fieldwork."
we completed further data analytics to determine if other similar scenarios have occurred for the fiscal year 2014-15. no other duplicate claim issues were noted for the fiscal year.
"business class travel there were two non-staff travel claims where congress guest speakers were reimbursed by nrc conference services on a cost recovery basis (congress expenses offset by congress revenues from registration fees, partnerships and sale of exhibit booths)."
both guest speakers utilized business class flights for the overseas portion.
"the nrc policy for non-staff travel allowances states that for air travel, only the economy rates are allowed."
the actual rules do not allow exception.
travel advances temporary travel advances can be issued on an individual basis according to specific pre-authorized travel requirements.
the advance would be accounted for as part of the travel expense claim and any excess would be returned by the traveller at that time.
"there were 24 travel advances for $32,276 issued during the fiscal year 2014-15, and all were cleared by year-end."
individual travel cards balances the traveller is responsible for the monthly card payments once they are reimbursed by nrc.
"the individual travel card would be cancelled by the provider if no payment is received after 90 days, and would only be reinstated after the full balance is paid."
interest is only charged after 60 days on the individual travel cards.
the cto verifies the past due report for the individual travel cards and will notify travellers as necessary.
there were 16 individual travel cards for the 35 staff travel claims tested.
"the audit fieldwork found one travel card with a high balance as of january 31, 2015."
the traveller had made regular monthly payments on the card.
the high balance was addressed by central travel office (cto) and paid by the traveller during the audit fieldwork.
computer programs nrc utilizes three different computer programs to process a travel claim in addition to a paper claim prepared using microsoft excel.
"sap is used to generate the payment and record the transaction, travel authority request approval workflow (taraw) database is used to obtain vp approval and finally, the financial dashboard is used to generate the travel authorization number (tan) and to reconcile the corporate travel card expense."
recommendations finance branch should develop training and communication to increase the awareness of the national joint council travel directives for both the traveller and the manager with performance certification approval authority.
[priority: moderate] finance branch should consider revising the nrc policy for non-staff travel allowances to allow for exceptions approved by the vice president.
[priority: moderate] finance branch should explore opportunities to harmonize the travel claim procedures to reduce the reliance on paper based travel claims and multiple computer programs.
"[priority: moderate] hospitality assessment overall, controls over hospitality expenditures remained effective in the interim operating environment (ioe)."
"the 16 item sample was selected from the unique non-po-s in the account for the period of july 29th to december 31st, 2014."
"the population for hospitality for this period was 385 claims totalling $115,400."
below we provide more details on the criteria which were not fully compliant (the supporting documentation and the standard costs).
supporting documentation there were seven hospitality claims with various issues related to supporting documentation.
"the hospitality blanket approval (blanket) forms existed, but were not in the file for one hospitality claim."
"the event and hospitality pre-approval forms were either missing for three files, incomplete for two files or were signed after the event for one file."
the blanket is used to reduce the administrative burden for re-occurring hospitality events and allows budget holders to initiate expenditure authority and performance certification hospitality for events they will attend.
the pre-approval form would still be required in all cases to verify the standard cost per person.
the three hospitality claims without the pre-approval form had calculated the standard cost per person as required.
the budget holder cannot benefit from the hospitality unless their supervisor signs the pre-approval or they have a blanket authority.
it is a best practice that a funds commitment be recorded.
"for practical reasons and with regard to materiality, the funds commitment is not required for non-po-s below $5,000."
"finance branch has already prepared, as of march 2015, a revised version of the blanket hospitality authority, which includes the fund commitment."
the completed forms are kept centrally for accounts payable verification.
there is also a simplified hospitality claim form to be used with the blanket authority which was implemented in may 2015.
the standard event and hospitality pre-approval form would be used when there is no blanket authority.
these revised hospitality forms prepared by finance branch address the supporting documentation finding and the standard costs finding which are discussed below.
"the standard costs are specified in the nrc financial management manual and tbs directive on travel, hospitality conference and event expenditures."
the audit fieldwork found one hospitality claim where the cost per person exceeded the standard cost levels.
"relocation assessment overall, controls over relocation expenditures remained effective in the interim operating environment (ioe)."
"the audit population for relocation was 34 relocations files with 53 reimbursements totalling $278,448."
the relocation files are processed by brookfield global relocation services (bgrs).
bgrs reimburses the current employee or the initial appointee directly during the relocation process.
the central travel office then reviews the relocation files and issue payments to bgrs.
"the limit for initial employees is $5,000, plus the brgs fee, unless a specific business case is approved by the chief financial officer."
"the cost of relocation for current employees has no fixed limit and can exceed $25,000."
"faa sec. 32 pre-approval four levels of faa sec 32 pre-approval presently exist at nrc for both initial appointee and current employee as follows: up to $10 k: director / executive director k to $15 k: general manager / director general k to $25 k: vice-president above $25 k: president or chief financial officer there were two open relocation files for current employees for whom the pre-approval was obtained from the general manager, but where the costs have already or will exceed the pre-approved amount of $15,000."
"for these cases, a new authorisation must be obtained at the next level."
"more specifically, the audit noted that the following audit criteria were compliant at 100 percent: appropriate supporting invoices were on file travel expenses were coded correctly travel authorization number (tan) were obtained when required (i.e. air and train travel) business case for travel was on file the reimbursement was made to the traveller (one case of duplicate payment, more details are provided below) travel advance were refunded by the employee there were no excessive (more than 90 days) outstanding balances due on individual travel cards the following audit criteria were at a lower compliance rate, but do not affect the overall assessment: appropriate faa sec. 32 was provided at a rate of 95 percent (52 / 55) appropriate faa sec. 34 certification was provided at a rate of 98 percent (54 / 55) vp approval was obtained were appropriate at a rate of 85 percent (35 / 41) claimed travel expenses were eligible at a rate of 93 percent (48 / 55) the audit sample for travel was selected based on the non-po payments processed after the cyber-intrusion, for the period of july 29th to december 31st 2014. a sample of 55 items was selected, 35 for staff travel and 20 for non-staff travel."
"faa sec. 32: pre-approval the faa specifies that the expenditure initiation must be approved for the eventual expenditure of funds, only when there is a sufficient budget available and before the work or activity is completed."
"otherwise, the three non-staff travel claims were eligible expenses, had appropriate supporting documentation and proper performance certification (sec 34 of the financial administration act)."
"there was one staff travel claim where the performance certification approval was documented on the travel claim by the direct supervisor of the traveller, but the direct supervisor did not have the corresponding authority in sap or in the temporary delegated authority schedule for the cost center or project number."
the appropriate performance certification was obtained during the audit fieldwork following the auditor enquiry.
"vice president approval prior to travel, there are two approval actions required based on the travel authorities."
"of the 28 which were approved before the cyber intrusion, two non-staff travel claims did not obtain the proper vp approval. from the 13 which were during the ioe period, four staff travel claims to conferences did not obtain the proper vp approval."
"eligible expenses the actual cto verification process does not require the cto staff to verify receipts for international claims for both staff and non-staff if the travel claim is below $2,500."
we found four issues related to meal and incidental expenses for claims under the threshold.
"however, due to the length of the flight and the stature of guest speakers, who are both nobel prize winners, the business class flight was objectively reasonable."
there was no travel advances associated with the audit sample selected.
otherwise the individual cards tested were used for appropriate travel expenses and were paid by the traveller in a reasonable amount of time (within 90 days).
this situation increases the level of effort and the risk of errors.
"more specifically, the audit noted that the following audit criteria were compliant at 100 percent: the approval process (faa sections 32 and 34) the payments were not made with an acquisition or an individual travel card while not on travel status the hospitality expenses claimed were eligible the payments were made through a funds commitment where appropriate the following audit criteria were at a lower compliance rate, but do not affect the overall assessment: the appropriate supporting documentation was on file at a rate of 63 percent (9 / 16) the hospitality expenses claimed were within acceptable limit (standard cost) at a rate of 94 percent (15 / 16) the audit sample for hospitality was selected from the luncheon food services general ledger account (50481)."
"one hospitality claim did not have a blanket authority for the budget holder who signed the pre-approval, the performance certification and who attended the event."
"there were also three instances where the blanket hospitality authority existed, but the corresponding funds commitment was not created."
standard costs the standard costs are the allowable per person costs for hospitality based on the equivalent per diem amounts taken from the national joint council travel directive.
"more specifically, the audit noted that the following audit criterion were compliant at 100 percent: the approval process (performance certification) (faa sections 34) the appropriate supporting documentation was on file the maximum amount of $5,000 for initial appointees, was not been exceeded without authorization relocation expenses claimed were eligible the following audit criteria was at a lower compliance which do not affect the overall assessment: appropriate faa sec. 32 pre-approval was provided at a rate of 87 percent (13 / 15) the audit sample for relocation was selected from the relocation in canada general ledger account (50191) and the relocation in/out canada account (50194) for the period of july 29th to december 31st, 2014. a total of 15 samples were selected, 12 were relocations for initial appointees and three were for relocation of current employees."
"below we provide more details on the criterion which were not fully compliant, appropriate faa sec. 32 pre-approval."
"following the auditor-s enquiry, the central travel office obtained the appropriate faa sec. 32 approval before the files were closed."
"appendix a: audit criteria line of enquiry audit criteria travel appropriate faa sec. 32 was provided appropriate faa sec. 34 certification was provided vp approval was obtained where appropriate appropriate supporting invoices were on file travel expenses claimed were eligible travel expenses were coded correctly travel authorization number (tan) were obtained where required (i.e. air and train travel) business case for travel was on file the reimbursement was made to the traveller travel advance were refunded by the employee there were no excessive (more than 90 days) outstanding balances due on individual travel cards hospitality appropriate faa sec. 32 was provided appropriate faa sec. 34 certification was provided appropriate supporting documentation (e.g. invoices, blanket authority form and pre-approval form) was on file payment were made through a funds commitment where appropriate payments were not made with an acquisition card hospitality expenses claimed were eligible (e.g. no alcoholic beverages) hospitality expenses claimed were within acceptable limit (i.e. standard cost) relocation appropriate faa sec. 32 was provided appropriate faa sec. 34 was provided appropriate supporting documentation (e.g. letter of offer, prior-authority for relocation and commitment advice form, and brookfield invoices and account summary) was on file the maximum amount of $5,000 for initial appointees, exception of authorized cases, had not been exceeded relocation expenses claimed were eligible"
"to achieve esdc-s personal information protection objectives, and to build privacy into the design and architecture of programs, services, systems and technologies, the department has established an integrated framework for privacy management consisting of the following pillars: governance and accountability: established roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms to support the department-s conformance to legal requirements, regulations, policies, standards, and public expectations."
"culture, training, and awareness: a privacy-respectful culture where employees, partners, and delivery agents understand their privacy obligations and are aware of tools, resources, policies, and processes related to privacy and personal information protection."
"assurance of compliance: formal processes and practices to ensure adherence to privacy legislation, policies and standards."
the following presents strengths and opportunities for improvement as they relate to the department-s framework for the management of personal information.
"governance and accountability governance bodies are in place and accountabilities are defined to support the management and protection of personal information the dppm, implemented in 2014, states that the dm of employment and social development is responsible for the department-s compliance with all statutes and treasury board policies and directives concerning the management and protection of personal information."
"this accountability is reaffirmed in the department-s delegation order, signed in august 2010 which is currently being updated."
"the dppm defines the roles and responsibilities for privacy, further stating that all employees are responsible for ensuring the safeguarding and protection of personal information under their custody and control."
the dppm also specifies functional responsibilities and accountabilities for senior management directly involved in administering the framework.
"these include the cpo, the dso, and the departmental it security coordinator."
"the cpo is designated as the department-s functional authority and senior advisor on privacy matters, and is accountable for the continual development and oversight of the dppm, its associated directives and instruments, and the privacy management program."
"having the dppm describe the functional roles of the cpo, dso and departmental it security coordinator represents an important effort in the integration of the functional areas in the management of personal information."
"the dppm also defines the oversight committees that support the protection of personal information and the consequences for violation of the dppm or related statutes, policies and procedures."
"pisc, a sub-committee to the corporate management committee (cmc), serves as the main governance body for setting the mandates for privacy and the protection of personal information, including policy development and supporting the horizontal coordination and prioritization of issues, plans and strategies."
the committee is co-chaired by the cpo and the dso and is comprised of directors general from esdc branches.
"in addition, there is regional representation on the committee through executive directors."
"key pisc activities in 2014 included: providing guidance on five new im/it directives in response to the esdc im/it security plan, reviewing the new sa&a process, implementing a new pia prioritization methodology, reviewing and approving an annual report to parliament on the administration of the privacy act and reviewing relevant external audit reports that touch on privacy."
"cmc receives regular updates from pisc on the progress of privacy, it security, im and physical security and approves privacy-related documentation."
"specific items discussed at cmc dating back to december 2013 include: review and approval of annual pisc priorities, directive on public interest disclosure, update on the departmental it security program, corporate secretariat plan, and integrated departmental security framework."
overall it was found that privacy-related matters are being reported effectively to cmc.
two of the main mechanisms that the department utilizes as part of its privacy framework are pias and isas.
pias are a requirement of the treasury board secretariat for any programs or initiatives that require the use of or transmission of personal information.
"an isa is a written record of understanding between esdc and third parties, such as other government departments or provincial and municipal governments, that outlines the terms and conditions under which personal information is shared between the parties."
"as part of the pisc-s mandate, the committee reviews, offers feedback and recommends approval of all pias and isas."
the audit team observed that pias and isas were regular agenda items requiring a great deal of attention at pisc meetings.
"therefore, pisc is sometimes seen by committee members interviewed as being too transactional, paying more attention to the review and approval of pias and isas rather than addressing broader horizontal issues associated with pias and isas."
"through interviews with regional and program executives who sat on pisc, it was found that the emphasis on review and approval of pias and isas caused members to be less engaged and overburdened with documentation."
"committee members often receive pia and isa documentation only one to two business days prior to committee meetings, making it challenging for pias and isas to be fully reviewed and for members to provide meaningful feedback."
"stewardship of personal information accessibility of relevant privacy documents needs improvement the dppm provides an overview of esdc-s pmf, which discusses the ten privacy principles that provide the basis upon which privacy policies, directives and procedures are founded."
"the dppm aligns with the desd act (including the privacy code within the desd act) and the privacy act, r.s.c. 1985, c. p-21."
esdc has also implemented a number of directives to support the policy suite and the overall stewardship and protection of personal information.
"the privacy management division and cpo have created a -stewardship of information- iservice page on the departmental intranet to provide all employees with access to the department-s framework for the management of personal information, including copies of relevant policies, directives and other guidance."
"links to mandatory training, and contact information for privacy questions and issues are provided."
"despite the department-s best effort to communicate its privacy policy suite, finding privacy-related documents is difficult on iservice and the intranet."
"for instance, the dppm was difficult to find using the search engines."
some additional important documents and links were found to be outdated.
"it would be advisable for the department to review the im process including naming conventions, use of metadata, storage of documents and timely uploading to the intranet and other repositories, so that policies and guidance tools related to privacy, security, it and im can be easily found and accessed by esdc employees."
it also shares the personal information of its clients where it has the legal authority to do so.
"the department currently manages more than 500 known agreements (which contain information sharing provisions) between itself and other federal institutions, levels of governments and foreign institutions, as well as internal esdc branches and regions."
"these agreements are called isas and they must meet the requirements of the desd act, part 4 (referred to as the privacy code) and the privacy act, r.s.c. 1985, c. p-21."
part 4 requires the minister-s (or delegate) approval of a written agreement with an organization outside the department where protected personal information is shared.
"per the delegation of authority instrument in place since 2010, the dm of esdc has been delegated by the minister the authority to sign agreements that contain information sharing provisions."
there is also a process in place requiring all isas to be reviewed by pisc and recommended to the dm for signature.
it was observed during related audit planning work and this audit engagement that a comprehensive repository of existing agreements is still outstanding.
the continued effort to inventory isas is important to provide the department with a sense of the magnitude of the number of isas in place.
"recommendation 1 the department should ensure that the current isa inventory is completed in a timely manner and that all agreements containing information sharing provisions are identified, assessed and managed on an ongoing basis."
"management response the corporate secretary, in her capacity as cpo and the senior assistant deputy minister of strategic and service policy branch concur with this recommendation."
the privacy management division will continue to manage isas until the program supporting the chief data officer is developed in the fall of 2015. departmental privacy incident monitoring and reporting to pisc need improvement there are various departmental branches involved in monitoring and reporting on privacy issues.
"the privacy management division, within the corporate secretariat, prepares esdc-s annual report on the administration of the privacy act, to highlight privacy management accomplishments and areas of concern/improvement."
"the report, tabled in parliament, provides statistics on completed pias, requests for information under the privacy act, r.s.c. 1985, c. p-21, privacy training and awareness activities, public interest disclosures, complaints and investigations, and material privacy breaches."
"iitb, in charge of managing it security, monitors on an ongoing basis the use of non-sanctioned external portable devices (e.g. usb storage devices, external hard drives)."
"when an incident occurs with a non-sanctioned portable device, an email is sent from it security to the employee-s manager explaining the nature of the incident."
the dso works in partnership with the cpo to maintain the directive on how to respond to security incidents involving personal information and the security incident reporting protocol for the department.
the dso security incident management unit (simu) has developed reference guides and tools to assist employees with security incident reporting.
simu conducts internal tracking of all security incidents involving personal information by recording incident details and mitigations.
"such systematic reporting and trend analysis would allow the dso, cpo, senior management and pisc to make informed strategic and horizontal decisions on the direction of the privacy program and validate the successes or shortcomings of the initiatives that have been implemented."
"recommendation 2 the dso, in partnership with the corporate secretary, in her capacity as cpo, should ensure that a mechanism is put in place to consolidate privacy incident reporting and trends across the department."
"management response the assistant deputy minister (adm) of integrity services branch and the corporate secretary, in her capacity as cpo concur with the recommendation."
technology is being developed to support privacy incident and trend reporting.
"once completed by september 2015, quarterly reporting to the dso, cpo and pisc will take place."
"culture, training, and awareness training and awareness programs have been established service canada college developed the mandatory siwb training that provides esdc employees with a high-level, integrated overview of the departmental privacy program, including it security and im."
the objective of the siwb training is to ensure that esdc employees can demonstrate a basic understanding of their roles and responsibilities for the use and care of departmental and/or personal information and correctly apply the acquired knowledge.
it also covers the consequences for not adhering to the prescribed privacy practices.
"after taking the on-line -stewardship- course, employees are required to pass a test, complete a learning report, and complete a post-course evaluation."
"as of august 2014, training was taken by 98.7% of employees, virtually all of whom (99.9%) passed the test."
"the siwb training manual provides reference material, all of which can be found on the departmental intranet/iservice."
it is the audit team-s opinion that siwb training is a departmental best practice as it integrates privacy principles with it and im principles.
senior management continues to use multiple approaches to communicate the importance of managing and safeguarding personal information.
"examples of initiatives include joint awareness sessions with the cpo, dso and director general of strategy, planning, architecture and management in iitb; stewardship of information intranet site; videos; emails from corporate communications; and awareness weeks."
training that is more tailored to frontline staff would be more relevant to reinforce the privacy principles. regions and programs stated that case studies and real life examples would be beneficial if included in the training.
"lastly, concerns were raised whether communications are actually being absorbed by employees, questioning whether the communication mediums and reinforcement need to be re-evaluated."
it would be beneficial for management to continue to assess the effectiveness of the communication and training strategies to ensure the framework for the management of personal information is being understood and applied across the department.
approaches could include providing periodic case studies and reinforcement by managers through team discussions of privacy principles and applicability to their employees.
"a pia is intended to contribute to senior management's ability to make fully informed policy, system design and contracting decisions."
"over the course of the audit, the team reviewed six of the 12 pias dating back to december 2013 which were presented to pisc in 2014."
the department has implemented a new methodology in 2014 for the prioritization of pias.
this approach is intended to provide more useful information to pisc members about the status of pias and to better allow enabling branches to strategically dedicate resources to the development of priority pias.
"management response the adm of iitb and the corporate secretary, in her capacity as cpo, concur with the recommendation."
iitb has completed the integration of tras into the sa&a process.
enhancing the alignment of the sa&a and pia processes will be completed by summer 2015.
"assurance of compliance the department uses various mechanisms to monitor the framework for the management of personal information overall, the department has taken multiple approaches to monitor its privacy framework."
"as mentioned earlier in this report, having a dedicated and functioning governance structure through bodies such as pisc and cmc and dedicated positions like the cpo ensure that privacy remains on the management agenda."
"in addition, esdc was also subjected to external and internal audits which highlighted areas for improvement."
action plans to address the gaps have been developed and are being implemented.
"lastly, the office of values and ethics reports on incidents involving the code of conduct and as such some of these incidents may involve privacy or security."
"at the program level, plpaps have identified a number of priority areas that are common across programs."
the department is monitoring systems for incidents and access controls.
all employee computers are being monitored for non-sanctioned usbs being plugged into the network.
iitb has also conducted scans of outgoing emails and sample phishing attacks.
"the dso has implemented security sweeps in nhq, and the audit team was also informed that security sweeps will be implemented in the regions in fiscal year 2015-2016."
"in regards to access controls, programs stated through interviews that there is an opportunity to strengthen monitoring of employee access to the various systems."
they provided examples of employees who have left the department or have moved within the department that have not had their access rights to esdc systems revoked.
weaknesses pertaining to the monitoring of access have been raised in previous audits.
action plans have been developed and are being implemented to address the gaps that have been identified.
conclusion the audit concluded that esdc-s pmf is adequate to address most privacy-related concerns.
"there are processes and controls in place that are sustainable over time, including a dedicated governance body and a policy suite for privacy management."
"opportunities exist to further integrate the pia, sa&a and tra processes, to institute consolidated privacy incident trend reporting, and to improve the stewardship of isas."
the evidence was gathered in accordance with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada and the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing.
appendix a: audit criteria assessment control component audit criteria rating it is expected that: governance and accountability the department-s governance structure clearly addresses privacy management.
"the department defines, documents, communicates and assigns accountability for its privacy policy and procedures."
privacy policies and procedures are reviewed and compared to the requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
"stewardship of personal information the control framework to protect the personal information throughout the life-cycle of the information is defined, documented and complies with the privacy act, r.s.c. 1985, c. p-21 and the department of employment and social development act."
"privacy policies and the consequences of noncompliance with such policies are communicated to the department-s personnel responsible for collecting, using, retaining, and disclosing personal information."
"the types of personal and sensitive information and the related processes, systems, and third parties involved in the handling of such information are identified."
such information is covered by the department-s privacy and related security policies and procedures.
a documented privacy incident and breach management program has been implemented.
"culture, awareness and training a privacy awareness program is in place, and training for selected personnel depending on their roles and responsibilities, is provided."
the department has an established code of conduct that addresses expectations for the protection of personal information.
management measures and reports on its performance against defined expectations for privacy management.
"assurance of compliance the department monitors compliance with its privacy policies and procedures and has procedures to address privacy-related inquiries, complaints and disputes."
stewardship of personal information: appropriate privacy protection to safeguard personal information through its life-cycle.
"pisc-s membership provides a strategic and horizontal privacy view to issues and risks and demonstrates the department-s commitment to integrate privacy, it security and im."
"esdc-s approach in developing the pias is seen as a best practice, within the department, to ensure that each program or initiative has a thorough analysis of the privacy risks and associated mitigation strategies in place before a program or initiative can use personal information."
an opportunity exists for pisc to review the current approach and focus of the committee in order to address horizontal privacy and security issues and risks.
the audit observed that searching for relevant privacy-related documentation was challenging.
"stewardship of isas remains a risk esdc collects, uses and discloses significant volumes of personal information to support the delivery of social and labour market programs and services."
the risks associated with data sharing and isas rest with the current incomplete inventory of isas entered into by the department.
"in the 2014-2015 crp, one of the main risk drivers for the -privacy/security of information- is the high number of isas involving personal information."
"the crp stated that there was a risk that esdc-s personal and sensitive information may be inadvertently or inappropriately accessed, collected, used, disclosed, retained and disposed of by employees and third parties."
to mitigate this risk cmc approved an isa action plan in february 2014 to address privacy risks and control gaps.
"the plan included a strategy to compile an inventory of all isas, to assess them for compliance with the privacy code and to identify, triage and prioritize isas (using a risk-based approach) that require updating."
"the privacy management division is currently working with branches and regions to build an inventory of isas and to conduct a risk triage, in an effort to help branches and regions understand their priorities in complying with current legislative requirements."
emails being sent from it security are for isolated incidents and are not systematically reported to governance bodies.
although the dso and the cpo manage privacy incidents on a transactional basis there is a lack of horizontal analysis and reporting which would be of benefit to the department.
"the training curriculum includes values and ethics, privacy roles, responsibilities, relevant policies, risks and threats, departmental security, it security, im, access to information and privacy requests."
"interviews during the audit revealed that there is -communication fatigue- within the department due to the frequency of communication and content that does not match the intended audience, particularly in regional operations."
"risk management departmental risk management includes privacy principles, however, risk processes for pias could be strengthened esdc has mechanisms in place to monitor privacy risk, including the department-s crp."
currently privacy/security is one of the department-s top risks listed in the crp and in branch/program risk registers.
one of the main risk drivers of the privacy/security risk is the high number of isas in the department.
"to help compile the crp, each branch compiles risks to their programs into a risk register which is then funneled into the crp."
"as part of this process senior management is interviewed, including the corporate secretary, to gather their thoughts on corporate-level risks."
"as per treasury board secretariat-s guidance, the key goal of a pia is to effectively identify, communicate and mitigate privacy risks not addressed through other departmental mechanisms."
"it is a cooperative process that brings together a variety of skill sets that include amongst others privacy, it and physical security risks."
"in an effort to improve the mitigation and monitoring of it risks, esdc proposed a new sa&a process in 2014 to replace the current tras for it security."
the new sa&a process is expected to ensure that it security risks are examined and mitigated before it solutions are implemented.
"furthermore, the department monitors risks through the implementation of plpaps."
in 2011 the department conducted a series of program risk assessments and developed plpaps in 2012-2013 to mitigate potential privacy risks that were identified.
risk assessments are currently being refreshed to identify and mitigate horizontal issues more easily across programs.
"the methodology tracks departmental pia priorities and includes risk levels, time sensitivities and the status of individual pias."
"recommendation 3 iitb, in partnership with the corporate secretary, in her capacity as cpo, should ensure that approaches to the pia, sa&a and tra processes are better aligned and integrated to provide a comprehensive view of privacy and security risks (physical and it) in a consistent and timely manner."
a risk assessment refresh is underway to triage the plpaps horizontally to allow for easier monitoring.
"however, there are still areas of the pmf that could be improved."
"statement of assurance in our professional judgement, sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were performed and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the conclusions reached and contained in this report."
the conclusions were based on observations and analyses at the time of our audit.
"risk management a risk assessment process is used to establish a risk baseline, to identify and assess new or changed risks to personal information, and to develop and update responses to such risks."
"best practice sufficiently controlled, low risk exposure controlled, but should be strengthened, medium risk exposure missing key controls, high risk exposure"
this section presents detailed findings and related recommendations for the audit.
appendix a provides a summary of all findings and conclusions for each of the criteria assessed by the audit team.
the audit team identified four opportunities for improvement resulting in four recommendations.
details of these observations and recommendations are provided below.
"during the course of the audit, minor findings were communicated directly to management."
governance the results of the audit identified that effective governance structures were established for oversight of the implementation of the gcm:bpm from the inception of the initiative.
the results of the audit identified that effective governance structures were established for oversight of the implementation of the gcm:bpm from the inception of the initiative.
"analysis the successful implementation of the gcm:bpm is recognized and supported by senior management as a critical initiative for the department, and is reflected in the project-s governance and oversight structures."
"in this regard, a number of oversight committees were established to oversee, advise on, and respond to, matters of relevance to the implementation of the gcm:bpm initiative."
the transformation initiative coordinating committee (ticc) was established at the beginning of the initiative in 2010.
the committee-s purpose was to provide overall direction for various supporting committees and branches responsible for the initiative and to make recommendations to the executive committee (excom).
"in july of 2012, the ticc was replaced by the grants and contributions modernization initiative (gcmi) steering committee that reports to excom."
"the committee is chaired by the assistant deputy minister (adm) strategic policy, planning and corporate affairs and its membership includes senior management of all sectors, thereby providing an effective forum to obtain the perspectives of cross-functional leadership."
"in addition to the committees noted above, two other committees are involved in the implementation of the gcm:bpm: the business operations committee, responsible for reviewing, endorsing, and/or approving courses of action in relation to gs&cs management, information management, technology management, and service-channel communication and management; and the modernization integration working group, responsible for helping to ensure coherence and common strategic directions among pch modernization initiatives."
the working group is chaired by the director general modernization integration and its membership consists of leads of modernization initiatives.
the mandate and composition of each of the above committees is clearly defined and formally documented in terms of reference.
"leading practices advocate the implementation of formal oversight committees, including steering committees, that are composed of senior representatives of key stakeholder groups and that are supported by formal terms of reference that clearly define their mandate and functioning."
"in addition to the formal committee structures, individual roles and responsibilities for the gcm:bpm are formally defined in the 2012-2013 gcmi roles and responsibilities document."
"a second charter, the grants and contributions modernization action plan (gcmap) was finalized in july of 2014."
"in addition to defining the project organization, governance structure and stakeholders, the charter defines the project objectives, expected outcomes, and deliverables."
the audit team identified one area for improvement in relation to governance.
"in addition, the gcmi committee recognised the importance of developing and implementing a formal performance measurement framework to measure and monitor the progress and achievements of the initiative in early 2010, near its inception."
management-s expectations with respect to efficiency gains were established and communicated from the inception of the initiative.
some analysis of time motion assessments to determine the efficiency gains resulting from the revised business processes in the three pilot programs were completed.
"in light of the significant impact of this initiative on the entire department, the high level of investment, and the intent for other departments to implement similar initiatives, it would be of benefit to both pch and other departments to have objective, reliable and complete information on the return on investment achieved as well as other qualitative benefits that have been realized from the implementation."
"recommendation the senior director - gcmap, in consultation with the strategic planning directorate, should ensure that a robust performance measurement framework be developed and implemented to enable management to monitor and report on its progress and results against defined performance measures, including outcomes-based measures."
implementation processes and procedures the results of the audit identified that a number of effective project management practices were in place to support the implementation of the gcm:bpm.
"the results of the audit identified that a number of effective project management practices were in place to support the implementation of the gcm:bpm. analysis a number of processes and procedures were implemented by the gcmi implementation team to manage the planning, development and implementation of the gcm:bpm initiative."
"in addition to sound project management practices that included formal and regular project progress reporting and clear governance structures as described previously in this report, a number of sound and leading project management practices were also in place to support the effective implementation of new business processes."
regular interaction and engagement with key stakeholders is a critical success factor in the implementation of any significant initiative to help secure the commitment of key stakeholders as well as to understand and respond to their needs and expectations.
the implementation phase was supported by formal workbooks providing details on the revised business processes.
"these workbooks, and other tools and templates supporting the new processes, were made available to stakeholders through the coe and helped to promote consistency in the application of the new process in practice."
consistency was further supported through formal training sessions.
"lastly, the adoption of a pilot project approach, under which process changes were applied to three programs through pilot projects, is consistent with leading practices as it helps provide a forum through which strengths, challenges, and potential issues with the proposed changes can be identified and rectified prior to implementing new processes on a global scale."
"the existence of a formal information management process within any organization is critical to help ensure that key information assets are properly maintained, retained, stored, and archived in a consistent manner across the organization to support effective decision-making and meet compliance requirements."
"formal information management guidelines and policies are particularly critical within matrix environments, such as that at pch."
"in addition, the current method of managing information leads to inefficiencies as information is not readily accessible."
"further, with the department viewed as a leader in the modernization of grants and contributions programs, queries and questions from other implementing departments should be expected, and a sound information management framework is key to supporting consistent, complete, relevant, and timely responses and support by pch management."
"recommendation the chief information officer (cio) should ensure a formal information management framework be implemented, consistent with federal government and departmental protocols for information management."
"in addition, and as noted previously, the analysis conducted on the three pilot projects was felt to be overstated due to a number of factors."
"the audit team further understands that within the gc-eos portion of the project implementation, a number of lessons learned exercises were conducted to identify opportunities for functional and project management improvements."
leading practices advocate conducting a post-implementation report on the progress made in delivering project deliverables and in providing overall benefits for significant projects and initiatives.
"such a post implementation report is typically conducted 3 to 6 months after project completion and is intended to help identify lessons learned for future projects by measuring the extent to which benefits and objectives have been achieved, confirming whether the project as completed was within scope, schedule and budget, and stating final project outcomes, among other factors."
"recommendation the senior director - gcmap should ensure that a post-implementation report is completed to assess the actual benefits delivered, confirm the achievement of stated project objectives, and to identify and share lessons learned."
appendix a - audit criteria the conclusions reached for each of the audit criteria used in the audit were developed according to the following definitions.
numerical categorization
"the findings are based on a combination of the evidence gathered through the examination of documentation, analysis, and interviews conducted for each of the audit criteria."
"the purpose of the gcmi steering committee is to help ensure that gcmi investments are achieving expected results that risks associated with the initiative are properly managed, and that changes are properly managed and communicated in accordance with relevant departmental and government of canada policies."
our review of a sample of meeting minutes and records of decision confirmed that this committee meets on a regular basis and receives timely information to support discussion and decision-making regarding issues related to the gcm:bpm implementation.
"membership within the various committees appropriately includes senior management from all directorates, including programs."
"although a formal project charter was not developed at the inception of the initiative, a grants & contribution - enterprise online system (gc-eos) project charter was created in march 2012."
"performance measurement and monitoring although formal and regular reporting on the progress of the initiative was provided to management and oversight committees and expected efficiency gains were defined up front, a formal performance measurement strategy and plan were not fully developed and implemented for the gcm:bpm."
"although formal and regular reporting on the progress of the initiative was provided to management and oversight committees and expected efficiency gains were defined up front, a formal performance measurement strategy and plan were not fully developed and implemented for the gcm:bpm. analysis based on an examination of a sample of meeting minutes and materials, the audit team confirmed that formal updates on the progress of the gcm:bpm were provided to excom, management committees and working groups on a regular basis."
"reports included information on the status of the overall project against plan and updates on the status of pilot projects, staff training, staff acceptance, information technology challenges, and files processed under the revised risk-based approach, among other key measures of the overall progress of the initiative."
"while a performance measurement plan was developed in late 2012, the indicators for each program and supporting tools and processes needed to collect the required information from clients had not been developed to support the implementation of this plan."
"as a result, formal measurement and monitoring of the impacts and outcomes of the gcm:bpm against expected performance was not conducted."
"the results supported the ability to quantify actual results achieved and determine if management expectations were met. while management has indicated that a logic model and supporting performance measurement strategy is being developed for the overall initiative, including system-related components, a formal assessment of actual performance against expected results for the business process modernization component as a whole was not completed."
"risk assessment there is a risk that management may not have sufficient and relevant information to measure and monitor the actual performance results achieved on the gcm:bpm initiative, particularly with respect to the impacts of the initiative on efficiency and client satisfaction."
"risk management the audit confirmed that a number of mechanisms were in place to identify, assess and develop mitigation plans for risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm. however, formal risk registers were not updated on a regular basis in the initial few years of the implementation."
"the audit confirmed that a number of mechanisms were in place to identify, assess and develop mitigation plans for risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm. however, formal risk registers were not updated on a regular basis in the initial few years of the implementation."
"analysis a number of formal and informal mechanisms to identify, manage and monitor risks related to the gcm:bpm were in place throughout the implementation of the gcm:bpm."
"at the inception of the project (december 2010), a formal risk register was developed that identified risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm."
risks were formally measured and ranked based on the expected impact if the risk were to occur and the probability of the risk occurring.
the register also included mitigating strategies and assigned formal responsibility for the implementation of risk mitigation action plans.
"while the audit confirmed that information on key challenges and risks of relevance to the gcm:bpm was discussed through various meetings, the initial risk register from december 2010 was not formally updated until january 2013."
"in addition, based on a comparison of the two formal risk registers, no additional risks had been identified since the initial register and no changes were noted in the risk ratings."
"in addition, in some instances, risk mitigation plans were overdue and/or had not been implemented in 2013 and no update was provided on any revised target date or action plan."
"in conjunction with the development of more formal and robust project management tools for the eos component of the initiative, the audit noted that beginning in november of 2012, more detailed and regular risk analysis was performed using project registers and risk dashboards."
"the dashboards identify risk, risk mitigation plans and rate risks based on impact and probability of occurrence."
our review of a sample of risk dashboards confirmed that they are updated on a regular basis.
"risk assessment management may not have had effective mechanisms in place to identify, assess, and monitor changes in risks related to the achievement of the gcm:bpm goals during the initial period of implementation, thereby impacting management-s ability to respond to emerging and changing risks in a timely manner."
"recommendation the senior director - gcmap should ensure that risk tracking and reporting activities are updated regularly, to ensure that emerging risks are identified and properly mitigated throughout the project life cycle."
"the audit observed evidence of formal engagement with key stakeholders, including representative of regional offices, at various stages of the implementation."
"the audit team identified two areas for improvement in relation to processes and procedures. information management a formal and well understood information management framework guiding the documentation, retention and sharing of information was not in place throughout the implementation period."
"a formal and well understood information management framework guiding the documentation, retention and sharing of information was not in place throughout the implementation period."
"analysis in the course of the audit, the team noted that although information of relevance to the initiative was maintained in a central repository, documentation was not organized in a manner that made it easily accessible for consultation."
"in addition, there was no formally defined classification and data taxonomy structure, nor were there policies or guidelines regarding information retention, naming conventions, version control, file and records storage, records destruction, and/or archival procedures. information is a critical asset to the department, and as such, should be managed with due regard to safeguarding its security and protection, accessibility, relevance and utility, and compliance with relevant legislation."
"risk assessment throughout the project, complete information may not have been available to assist management in monitoring the evolution of the gcm:bpm, as well as identifying issues that may impact the success of the project."
post-implementation report a post-implementation report has not been completed.
a post-implementation report has not been completed.
"analysis although time motion studies and analysis of efficiency gains was completed based on an analysis of the results of the three pilot projects, no further analysis was conducted for the gcm:bpm as a whole."
risk assessment opportunities to implement additional functional improvements or changes to business processes may not be identified in a timely manner and management may have difficulty -proving- and promoting the value of the initiative without a post-implementation report.

"the existence of a formal information management process within any organization is critical to help ensure that key information assets are properly maintained, retained, stored, and archived in a consistent manner across the organization to support effective decision-making and meet compliance requirements."
"formal information management guidelines and policies are particularly critical within matrix environments, such as that at pch."
"in addition, the current method of managing information leads to inefficiencies as information is not readily accessible."
"further, with the department viewed as a leader in the modernization of grants and contributions programs, queries and questions from other implementing departments should be expected, and a sound information management framework is key to supporting consistent, complete, relevant, and timely responses and support by pch management."
"recommendation the chief information officer (cio) should ensure a formal information management framework be implemented, consistent with federal government and departmental protocols for information management."
"in addition, and as noted previously, the analysis conducted on the three pilot projects was felt to be overstated due to a number of factors."
"the audit team further understands that within the gc-eos portion of the project implementation, a number of lessons learned exercises were conducted to identify opportunities for functional and project management improvements."
leading practices advocate conducting a post-implementation report on the progress made in delivering project deliverables and in providing overall benefits for significant projects and initiatives.
"such a post implementation report is typically conducted 3 to 6 months after project completion and is intended to help identify lessons learned for future projects by measuring the extent to which benefits and objectives have been achieved, confirming whether the project as completed was within scope, schedule and budget, and stating final project outcomes, among other factors."
"recommendation the senior director - gcmap should ensure that a post-implementation report is completed to assess the actual benefits delivered, confirm the achievement of stated project objectives, and to identify and share lessons learned."
appendix a - audit criteria the conclusions reached for each of the audit criteria used in the audit were developed according to the following definitions.
numerical categorization
"the findings are based on a combination of the evidence gathered through the examination of documentation, analysis, and interviews conducted for each of the audit criteria."
"the purpose of the gcmi steering committee is to help ensure that gcmi investments are achieving expected results that risks associated with the initiative are properly managed, and that changes are properly managed and communicated in accordance with relevant departmental and government of canada policies."
our review of a sample of meeting minutes and records of decision confirmed that this committee meets on a regular basis and receives timely information to support discussion and decision-making regarding issues related to the gcm:bpm implementation.
"membership within the various committees appropriately includes senior management from all directorates, including programs."
"performance measurement and monitoring although formal and regular reporting on the progress of the initiative was provided to management and oversight committees and expected efficiency gains were defined up front, a formal performance measurement strategy and plan were not fully developed and implemented for the gcm:bpm."
"although formal and regular reporting on the progress of the initiative was provided to management and oversight committees and expected efficiency gains were defined up front, a formal performance measurement strategy and plan were not fully developed and implemented for the gcm:bpm. analysis based on an examination of a sample of meeting minutes and materials, the audit team confirmed that formal updates on the progress of the gcm:bpm were provided to excom, management committees and working groups on a regular basis."
"while a performance measurement plan was developed in late 2012, the indicators for each program and supporting tools and processes needed to collect the required information from clients had not been developed to support the implementation of this plan."
"the results supported the ability to quantify actual results achieved and determine if management expectations were met. while management has indicated that a logic model and supporting performance measurement strategy is being developed for the overall initiative, including system-related components, a formal assessment of actual performance against expected results for the business process modernization component as a whole was not completed."
"risk assessment there is a risk that management may not have sufficient and relevant information to measure and monitor the actual performance results achieved on the gcm:bpm initiative, particularly with respect to the impacts of the initiative on efficiency and client satisfaction."
"risk management the audit confirmed that a number of mechanisms were in place to identify, assess and develop mitigation plans for risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm. however, formal risk registers were not updated on a regular basis in the initial few years of the implementation."
"the audit confirmed that a number of mechanisms were in place to identify, assess and develop mitigation plans for risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm. however, formal risk registers were not updated on a regular basis in the initial few years of the implementation."
"analysis a number of formal and informal mechanisms to identify, manage and monitor risks related to the gcm:bpm were in place throughout the implementation of the gcm:bpm."
"at the inception of the project (december 2010), a formal risk register was developed that identified risks related to the implementation of the gcm:bpm."
the register also included mitigating strategies and assigned formal responsibility for the implementation of risk mitigation action plans.
"while the audit confirmed that information on key challenges and risks of relevance to the gcm:bpm was discussed through various meetings, the initial risk register from december 2010 was not formally updated until january 2013."
"in addition, based on a comparison of the two formal risk registers, no additional risks had been identified since the initial register and no changes were noted in the risk ratings."
"in addition, in some instances, risk mitigation plans were overdue and/or had not been implemented in 2013 and no update was provided on any revised target date or action plan."
"in conjunction with the development of more formal and robust project management tools for the eos component of the initiative, the audit noted that beginning in november of 2012, more detailed and regular risk analysis was performed using project registers and risk dashboards."
"the dashboards identify risk, risk mitigation plans and rate risks based on impact and probability of occurrence."
our review of a sample of risk dashboards confirmed that they are updated on a regular basis.
"risk assessment management may not have had effective mechanisms in place to identify, assess, and monitor changes in risks related to the achievement of the gcm:bpm goals during the initial period of implementation, thereby impacting management-s ability to respond to emerging and changing risks in a timely manner."
"recommendation the senior director - gcmap should ensure that risk tracking and reporting activities are updated regularly, to ensure that emerging risks are identified and properly mitigated throughout the project life cycle."
"the audit observed evidence of formal engagement with key stakeholders, including representative of regional offices, at various stages of the implementation."
"the audit team identified two areas for improvement in relation to processes and procedures. information management a formal and well understood information management framework guiding the documentation, retention and sharing of information was not in place throughout the implementation period."
"a formal and well understood information management framework guiding the documentation, retention and sharing of information was not in place throughout the implementation period."
"analysis in the course of the audit, the team noted that although information of relevance to the initiative was maintained in a central repository, documentation was not organized in a manner that made it easily accessible for consultation."
"in addition, there was no formally defined classification and data taxonomy structure, nor were there policies or guidelines regarding information retention, naming conventions, version control, file and records storage, records destruction, and/or archival procedures. information is a critical asset to the department, and as such, should be managed with due regard to safeguarding its security and protection, accessibility, relevance and utility, and compliance with relevant legislation."
"risk assessment throughout the project, complete information may not have been available to assist management in monitoring the evolution of the gcm:bpm, as well as identifying issues that may impact the success of the project."
post-implementation report a post-implementation report has not been completed.
a post-implementation report has not been completed.
"analysis although time motion studies and analysis of efficiency gains was completed based on an analysis of the results of the three pilot projects, no further analysis was conducted for the gcm:bpm as a whole."
risk assessment opportunities to implement additional functional improvements or changes to business processes may not be identified in a timely manner and management may have difficulty -proving- and promoting the value of the initiative without a post-implementation report.
"accountability structure communication between operations and the corporate classification directorates within the hr branch needs improvement an effective organizational accountability structure allows for authorities, responsibilities and accountabilities to be clearly established and is essential to increasing the prospects of an organization achieving its desired objectives."
"we expected the department to have a functioning organizational accountability structure for the classification function which provides for clear responsibilities and accountabilities and permits effective lines of communication, coordination and reporting."
"pwgsc-s organizational structure to manage its classification function involves three directorates in the hr branch: operations; corporate classification; and, executive services."
both operations and the corporate classification directorates report to different directors general while executive services reports directly to the adm hr branch.
"an organizational structure that divides responsibilities allows each directorate to function in an independent, yet complementary manner."
"operations directorate provides services in organizational design and classification, classifies positions and provides advice on work descriptions."
it was created in april 2012 to centralize the classification operations and services function which were formerly coordinated by 10 directors in the hr branch.
"the corporate classification directorate is responsible for developing policy, monitoring and reporting, systems and procedures, and managing grievances."
"the current organizational structure allows a separation of responsibility between development of policies and procedures (corporate classification), the implementation of those policies and procedures (operations), and independent and objective monitoring of that implementation (corporate classification)."
"to fully benefit from this structure, it is important that operations and the corporate classification directorates work well together and that there is good synergy, coordination and communications since each plays a unique and independent, yet complementary role, in managing the classification function."
"as noted, corporate classification monitors and reports on operations- activities to ensure compliance with classification policies, standards and guidelines."
"we identified weaknesses in communication between the two groups on the scope covered by the monitoring activities, as well as the criteria that were used to establish expectations."
we were also informed of concerns related to the communication of the findings.
we also identified a need for improvement in communications and coordination between the two directorates related to the coaching of those employees who are pursuing their accreditation in classification.
hr advisors in operations provide tutoring to these trainees while the corporate classification advisors critique the work samples of the trainees and mark case binders to provide the final decision on whether competencies have been met for accreditation.
we were informed the results of the critique of work samples and marking of case binders are passed on to the tutors in operations without direct communication with the trainee.
the current organizational structure allows for a division of responsibilities and accountabilities.
effective communications is essential in building trust and creating an effective working relationship between the directorates.
enhancement of communication between both directorates would help realize the full benefits associated with the centralization of classification activities and separation of responsibilities.
"shared responsibility for classification between human resource branch and operational managers creates challenges authority is the right to direct and exact performance, responsibility is the obligation to perform, and accountability is the duty to report on the fulfillment of one-s responsibility and the liability created for the use of authority."
"in an organization, authority is formally delegated and this authority is aligned with individual-s responsibilities."
"we expected to find, in the case of classification, that the authority for classification decisions would be aligned with an individual-s delegated authorities and departmental responsibilities, and that accountability for decision would be clearly defined."
"at pwgsc, the deputy minister has been delegated the authority and responsibility to classify positions from tb and is accountable for administering and ensuring the integrity of its classification system."
the tb policy on classification system and delegation authority provides for the deputy minister to authorize both hr advisors and/or operational managers to exercise classification authority.
"through the pwgsc framework instrument of human resources delegation, authority to classify positions is formally delegated to hr advisors who have completed their accreditation in classification and are working in the hr branch."
"the only exception is for executive positions, whereby the authority to classify positions resides exclusively with the deputy minister."
"at pwgsc, a decision has been made to exclude operational managers from classification authority."
"as such, only hr advisors who have completed the accreditation in classification and are working in the hr branch have this authority."
operational managers currently initiate and influence classification decisions to the extent of ensuring their organizational structure and employee duties are designed and allocated efficiently.
"they also ensure that work descriptions, a basis for classification evaluation, are current and accurate."
"hr advisors ensure that the classification decisions are in line with tb and departmental policies, standards and guidelines, and are ultimately accountable for the classification decision."
"thus, at pwgsc, the hr advisor has accountability for the integrity of the departmental classification system, while both the hr advisor and operational manager share responsibilities to support the discharge of this accountability."
"to have an effective departmental classification system, a collaborative approach between the hr advisor and the operational manager is important."
"more specifically, a review of work descriptions found 46% of work descriptions had reached the five year review date as of december 2013 without update."
"the delegated authority for classification decisions is aligned with an individual-s departmental responsibilities, and accountability is clearly defined."
"stronger leadership by the hr branch would help ensure work descriptions are current and accurate, and support the department-s accountability for integrity in the classification system."
training program the current classification accreditation program has had few trainees complete the program as expected the tb policy on classification system and delegation of authority requires that the deputy minister -ensure that managers and hr advisors understand and apply the classification system-; as well the deputy minister is required -to promote classification competence in their managers-.
we expected hr advisors engaged in the classification process to have the requisite knowledge and skills to support them in discharging their classification responsibilities.
the department has an accreditation program for hr advisors that was created in may 2010.
the program sets out the department-s requirements for obtaining organization and classification accreditation as well as for having delegated authority to classify positions.
these requirements are consistent with the tb-s training/learning competency profile for organization and classification advisors.
"upon graduation from the program, the employee will obtain the delegated authority for classification from the deputy minister."
the program is aimed at increasing the number of accredited hr advisors in the department.
"at the end of 2013, there were only four trainees who had completed the program since its inception."
"currently, only nine of 19 (47%) hr advisors have their accreditation in operations."
this has created significant challenges for operations since non-accredited advisors can only perform work up to the classification decision-making point.
"therefore, their work has to be reviewed by an accredited hr advisor in order to take a classification decision."
this results not only in a duplication of effort but precludes the accredited hr advisor from attending to his or her own caseload.
"each year, the branch anticipates a certain number of employees will receive their accreditation."
"in 2012, only one trainee met the accreditation requirements instead of the five who were expected to graduate."
"currently, there are nine trainees in the accreditation program and six of them have been in the program for more than four years."
the current situation has been caused by several factors.
the accreditation program functions without any set timeframes for fulfilling all the applicable steps and there is no specific progression plan for the trainee to complete.
nor does it address the issue of removing the trainee should he/she continue to be unsuccessful within a given period.
tutoring is expected to come from an accredited hr advisor who plays an important role in the success of the trainee.
"the tutor-s role ranges from developing a learning plan, supporting the trainee and allocating time for learning, commenting on their work, critiquing work samples and acting as an evaluator during the trainee-s presentation."
"in addition, some of the trainees expressed concern that feedback and comments offered by the corporate classification directorate on the case binders submitted for evaluation were not provided and explained directly to the trainees."
"thus, the areas that needed to be improved to obtain an accreditation were not always clear to the trainees."
"the new proposed program provides specific requirements for the roles and responsibilities of trainees, tutors, and the directors from operations and the corporate classification directorate."
it calls for the director of operations to assign an accredited hr advisor as a tutor to each trainee to develop a learning plan for the individual.
"there is also a mandatory requirement for on-the-job training that deals specifically with each competency level relating to work descriptions, classification evaluations, chairing of evaluation committees, organizational design, and classification grievances."
"addressing the weaknesses in the design and management of the accreditation program will help improve the success of the program, which will help to address capacity issues within the hr advisor group."
"classification training courses offered to operational managers have low participation rates according to the requirements described in the department-s framework people management philosophy and our commitments, operational managers have a responsibility to ensure the classification system is consistently applied, ensure their organizational structure and employee duties are designed and allocated efficiently, and that work descriptions are current and accurate."
"it is important, therefore, that operational managers receive adequate training and have knowledge of classification."
we expected operational managers would have the training necessary to discharge their classification responsibilities.
the corporate classification directorate offers three courses to managers and employees: managers and classification; work description writing; and organizational design and human resources planning.
"since april 2011, these courses have been offered to departmental employees and managers free of charge."
the course material is targeted towards persons who hold supervisory responsibilities.
"the duration of the courses, on average, is approximately two hours."
"despite the fact that courses are promoted and advertised on the department-s e-mail communiqu- -in the know- and on the department-s telesource two or three times a year, the rate of participation and attendance at classification learning activities, particularly in the national capital region, continues to be low."
"in 2013, 20 out of 38 planned sessions (53%) were cancelled due to low registration."
"on average, if there are four registrants, a course will be offered."
"as of december 31, 2013, there were 2,485 encumbered supervisory positions in the department."
"of this total, 220 people participated in the course -7700-manager and classification-- a session that informs operational managers about their roles and responsibilities with respect to classification."
"the -work description writing- course -a session for managers aimed to simplify the work description writing process, had 85 participants and 190 attended the -organizational design and human resource planning- course -a session explaining the steps of the integrated hr plan and organizational design processes."
"given the potential impact job classification has on the operating costs of the department and the importance of sound human resource management, it is important that operational managers better understand their role in the classification process."
the corporate classification directorate had recommended to hr branch management that learning activities in classification and organizational design be added to the list of mandatory training for managers.
"as a result, the hr branch needs to refine its strategy to better encourage and promote management training to enable managers to fully understand the importance of accurate work descriptions and their role in classification."
sound knowledge of the classification system by operational managers will help limit the impact that inaccurate work descriptions have on the classification system and human resource management.
classification operations no formal procedures for classification have been established effective procedures are part of a management control framework.
standard operating procedures serve as the basis for actions to be carried out in a consistent and structured manner.
procedures must be well developed and comply with the relevant policies and directives.
"with regards to classification, it is important that standardized procedures exist."
these procedures should be followed as the relative value of all work in the public service must be established in an equitable and consistent manner since it provides the basis for compensating all employees.
"following centralization of the classification function in 2012, efforts to standardize operating procedures were made within the operations- administration centre but these procedures were not formally approved and communicated to staff."
these procedures were posted to a common shared drive in the hr branch for employees to use.
we were informed that some hr advisors and staff were unaware of their existence; others used them on an ad-hoc basis.
"classification rationale, which includes details on how an assessment of a particular occupational group is performed; the criteria used to measure the value of a position; the justification for utilizing the classification standard; and comparisons with benchmark positions, was missing or incomplete, on average, in 22% of the files reviewed."
"to better understand and gain insight into the classification process and quality of file documentation, the audit team conducted a review of classification files."
we reviewed the creation of new positions and the review/update of positions for the period of july to december 2013. our review identified similar documentation issues to those identified by the corporate classification directorate.
nor was there evidence in all files that the requirements on the checklist were included.
"there are limited systems and controls in place to ensure the accuracy, currency and quality of the department-s work descriptions a work description is a document that describes the work requirements of a position."
a generic work description is a document that records the work assigned to a number of similar or identical positions at the same occupational group and level and across organizational boundaries.
"an accurate and up-to-date, generic or non-generic work description provides a basis for the compensation of employees in the public service."
"work descriptions are essential building blocks for most human resources management functions, such as recruitment, promotion, performance management, career management, learning, labor relations and human resources planning."
most collective agreements entitle employees to a complete and current statement of duties.
"due to the importance of work descriptions in human resource management, the tb -guideline on work description writing- states that -the deputy head is responsible for ensuring there are effective systems and controls in place to ensure the accuracy, currency and quality of work descriptions.- we expected to find that departmental work descriptions were accurate and that there were systems and controls in place to conduct periodic reviews to ensure their accuracy, currency and quality."
the hr branch employs the human resources management system (hrms) to record employees- classification information.
the hrms records the latest date in which a work description is reviewed.
the system can also generate a report showing that the work description has reached its five year anniversary date for re-review but there is no automated control to flag when this particular date has been reached.
"often managers become aware of the need to update the work description when there is an operational requirement to do so, such as initiating staffing of a position."
this approach further delays the actual staffing process since managers must update the work description before they can begin staffing a vacant position.
"by december 2013, the number of positions reaching their cyclical review date had increased to 7,659 or 46% of all departmental positions."
"in the 2012 classification performance report, 40% of classified positions were linked to one of the 276 generic work descriptions (gwd)."
an increase in the application of gwds is encouraged by ochro since they are considered more efficient and provide fairness in establishing relativity for position classifications.
"currently, one of hr branch-s priorities is to increase the usage of gwds, thus it is important that gwds are reviewed and updated periodically."
limited effort had been directed toward the review of coincidence between the actual duties of a position and the work description.
"in 2008, the corporate classification directorate examined a sample of 75 positions to verify that the work actually being performed was coincident with the work description."
no further reviews have been conducted.
"currently, the corporate classification directorate and operations are working together to populate a work description repository."
the repository will contain pre-classified work descriptions that will assist managers in updating their work descriptions.
the development of systems and controls relating to the update of work descriptions will help ensure they are current and up to date.
monitoring and reporting there are no mechanisms in place to address the issues identified in classification performance reports management practices and controls need to be actively monitored to allow early and effective preventive and remedial action to take place.
tb-s classification monitoring framework requires that departments invest resources in classification monitoring with a view to improving the integrity of the classification system.
"we expected to find that the department had identified responsibilities related to classification monitoring, that findings were reported to senior management, and that corrective actions were being taken."
the monitoring and reporting function is an on-going exercise that is carried out by classification manager and one advisor from the corporate classification directorate.
"the areas subject to monitoring include compliance with policies, the quality of documentation of classification decisions, and the application of the instrument for classification delegation."
"in certain instances, the monitoring exercise was conducted in response to senior management requests with specific objectives."
a sampling of classification transactions serves as a basis for reporting results and the review consists primarily of examining paper files.
"the annual departmental classification performance report is tabled at the hr committee, signed off by the deputy minister and subsequently forwarded to ochro."
the report is the departmental instrument used to inform the deputy minister about the status of the classification function in the department.
"for the past five years, the annual report has identified similar trends and transactional issues with the classification system."
the latest departmental performance report for 2012 was published in april 2013.
"in accordance with the new direction proposed by ochro-s draft policy on classification, the next report will cover a two year period (january 1, 2013 to december 31, 2014) and will be released in 2015."
we determined the method of conducting the monitoring exercise can be strengthened.
"as such, despite the repetitiveness of the findings reported over the past several years, only marginal improvements were noted."
"in reviewing the results of the monitoring activities (as reported in the annual departmental classification performance reports), we found a similarity of findings from one year to the next, which suggests there are breakdowns preventing correction of identified issues."
"certain trainees indicated they felt it would be beneficial if both directorates, along with the trainee, meet collectively to discuss the results of this review and point out areas on which improvement is needed."
we found the shared responsibility between hr advisors and operational managers for classification has created challenges.
"as noted, responsibility for job descriptions at the individual job level rests with operational managers, but the integrity of the classification system, which could be compromised by out of date and inaccurate job descriptions, is the accountability of hr branch."
"to assist hr advisors in appropriately exercising their delegated classification authority, the department has developed an accreditation program to help them to effectively discharge their responsibilities."
we found there were not as many trainees completing the program as expected.
"while the accreditation program was designed to generally take 18 to 24 months to complete, we found that it was taking on average 31 months to complete."
there were no trainee graduates from the program in 2013.
"moreover, the program does not specify the consequences should a trainee be unsuccessful in completing one or more of the program-s assessments."
"further, we found that there were five individuals promoted to the pe3 level without having the recommended accreditation and the authority to make classification decisions."
"given the limited success rate of the accreditation program, the corporate classification directorate drafted a new accreditation program in 2013, which was not formally approved at the time of the audit."
"similar to the current accreditation program, the proposed program does not specify any timelines or consequences for unsuccessful assessments."
they also are required to participate in classification committees as appropriate.
we found that the participation rate for the training courses offered to operational managers is low.
"this suggestion, however, was not approved due to a concern that many courses were already on the mandatory training list."
"we expected to find standardized operating procedures were developed and applied relative to each of the various classification activities, and that classification decisions were supported by appropriate documentation."
the lack of formalized standardized operating procedures accounted for some of the deficiencies identified through the corporate classification directorate-s monitoring exercise.
"in particular, the lack of supporting documentation within classification files was observed."
"relativity analysis, an essential and mandatory component of any classification decision to ensure similar jobs have similar ratings, was not always factored into the classification decision."
"their reviews indicated that 47%, 51% and 60% of the sample files in 2011, 2012 and the first six months of 2013 respectively contained a relativity report."
"in addition, the audit team also noted that the position file checklist, used by operations to ensure that all required paperwork was present within a classification file, was not always consistent from one file to the next."
this contributes to the lack of documentation on classification files in support of the appropriateness of classification decisions.
formalizing standard procedures and clarifying requirements for documentation will help to ensure classification decisions are consistent and appropriately documented.
generic and non-generic work descriptions should contain the necessary information needed to evaluate the work using the appropriate classification standard.
"operational managers, consequently, are not being notified when their work descriptions require review and update."
"the annual departmental classification performance report for 2012 indicated that 7,015 classified positions, or 43% of the total positions in the department, had reached their cyclical review date of five years."
we also found that there were no controls in place to ensure that the generic work descriptions were kept up-to-date and used appropriately.
"however, there are risks associated with their use, for instance when utilizing a gwd from other organizations, one has to be careful to ensure that they are appropriate in the new organizational context."
a gwd inappropriately classified may extend misclassification across many positions.
the results indicated that 55% of work descriptions were not coincident.
"although a framework for the entire update process has yet to be completed and approved, the framework will stipulate that once a work description reaches its review date, a notice will be sent to the manager to validate its content, hence updating the work description in the repository."
we found that responsibility for monitoring and reporting of classification activities was clearly defined.
a risk assessment is undertaken by the corporate classification directorate to determine the level of risk and associated vulnerabilities in the classification system every year prior to commencing the monitoring exercise.
the scope and criteria of the monitoring exercise had not been discussed and agreed upon by the corporate classification and operations directorates before the exercise was started.
"in addition, we were informed that the operations directorate was not debriefed on the findings of the monitoring exercise, nor provided an opportunity to validate the results."
we also found that there were no formal recommendations or management responses/action plans presented in the annual classification performance reports to support correction of the issues identified.
"while there was an annual operational plan which dealt with some issues indentified, there was no specific action plan developed in response to the report."
"finally, there was no mechanism to monitor the implementation of corrective actions in the operational plan."
appropriate follow up on the findings of the monitoring activities will help to support improvements in operations.
the policy for payment of institute advisory board member expenses is not in compliance with the cihr act (criterion 21b).
"the institutes are integral to cihr and several requirements pertaining to them are included in cihr-s enabling legislation, the cihr act."
"one of these requirements is to reimburse expenses for institute advisory board (iab) members on a basis fixed by the governor-in-council; in other words, in accordance with government of canada policies."
non-compliance with legislation could result in reputational damage or additional scrutiny in future years.
b) a process should be established with defined accountabilities and responsibilities to verify all proposed program changes against legislative requirements and with the proper subject matter experts.
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the finance branch has recently assumed overall responsibility for the isg program."
"as a result, the finance branch is currently in the process of developing a clear and comprehensive framework to effectively manage the isg program."
the framework will outline specific responsibilities and accountabilities for management of the isg program.
"this framework will include: a summary of all key policies and procedures to ensure the program-s adherence to the cihr act, (including reimbursement of iab member expenses), the federal policy and directive on transfer payments, the terms and conditions for the isg program and all other legislative requirements."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all proposed program changes will be reviewed to ensure legislative requirements are accounted for."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a documented process for ensuring that any program changes are in adherence with legislative requirements.
expected completion: june 2015 there is no process to ensure modifications to the isg program are assessed for compliance with the isg t&c (criterion 3).
"t&c for transfer payment programs are initially approved by treasury board, and authority for approving subsequent changes varies depending on the significance of the change."
ministers are authorized to approve minor amendments and may also delegate this authority to the deputy head of the organization.
the isg terms and conditions (t&c) approved in 2008 state that sds may be appointed for terms up to 7 years.
"starting in 2009, sd terms were extended to a total of 8 years."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all proposed program changes will be reviewed to ensure the isg t&c-s requirements are accounted for."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: ensuring that a clear process is established for amending the terms and conditions of the isg program as required.
"expected completion: june, 2015."
"deficiencies in the reporting and monitoring of planned and actual isg expenditures have resulted in an impairment to manage the release of funds to the institutes (criteria 18, 19f, 25, 26)."
"at the start of each fiscal year, sds are required to submit an annual budget of planned expenditures for their institute, categorized by eligible expense type."
an annual financial report detailing actual expenditures by eligible category is due to cihr by june 30 for the preceding fiscal year.
the report format and expense categories are prescribed by cihr.
"the annual financial reports are recorded by cihr finance into a spreadsheet maintained since the start of the program and more recently, forecast and actual expenditures have been combined into one place with the intent to perform variance analysis."
"a review of the financial information as part of this audit revealed that the program carried an overall unspent balance of between $5.5m and $7.35m over the last six fiscal years ending on march 31, 2014."
"as a result, cihr may have missed opportunities to reallocate and maximize the use of available isg funds within the existing t&c."
"b) institutes should be provided with guidelines regarding the reporting of expenses, to ensure consistency in reporting of expenditures."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a monitoring regime of planned and actual expenditures to effectively inform program decisions, including the release of future funding."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: guidelines for the institutes regarding the reporting of isg expenses."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
the program t&c specify that the isg continues as long as the recipient meets the eligibility requirements.
eligible recipients are defined in the t&c as -canadian institutions that host a cihr institute headed by an sd affiliated with them-.
"when an institute transitions to a new host institution, the previous recipient ceases to meet the eligibility requirements."
"the isg ends, funded activities cease, and the grant is not eligible for renewal."
the isg agreement includes a provision for the recipient to repay the outstanding balance to cihr at the end of the grant and the directive on transfer payments requires amounts repayable to be recorded as debts to the crown.
the practice of transferring unspent balances to the new host institution is not in compliance with the directive on transfer payments.
"b) alternate approaches should be considered to eliminate large balances at the end of an isg; for example, reduce the funding to the outgoing institution for the last year of its grant, thus avoiding a large unspent balance when the grant expires."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all unspent funds at the end of a grant will be returned to cihr as per the isg agreement."
the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: a clear process in compliance with the directive on transfer payments for what happens to unspent isg funds at the end of a scientific director-s term.
"expected completion: june, 2015."
"b) responsibility director, finance action agreed - addressed in the response to recommendation 4a) expected completion: june, 2015."
the institute support grant agreement template is not fully compliant with the requirements in the amended terms and conditions and the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 3).
the isg agreement formalizes the arrangements between cihr and the host institution for the hosting of the institute.
"the following items are missing: an indemnification clause to the benefit of the crown as per requirement 8 of the directive, appendix f; a provision for making information public per requirement 14 of the directive, appendix f; and a clause regarding official languages, as mandated by the t&c and requirement 16) of the directive, appendix f."
missing elements may result in exposure to cihr through increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders.
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an updated template for isg agreements to ensure adherence to all key legislative requirements."
"expected completion: november, 2015."
"in order to be awarded an isg, the host institution is required to complete and submit an application for funding."
elements that must be included in the application for the grant are defined by the program t&c.
"in the case of a grant, the application is the main mechanism to obtain information from the potential recipient regarding their eligibility for the grant and confirm their understanding of the approved uses of the funding."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - effective immediately, all new applications will include all elements as described in the t&c the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an updated isg application form to ensure all key criteria of the terms and conditions are addressed, including sd assignment and coi requirements."
"expected completion: june, 2015. process documentation when an institute transitions requires improvement (criteria 1c, 1d, 2b, 2c)."
"gc has fulfilled its responsibility to establish and maintain the institutes through the initial creation of the 13 institutes, the establishment of a support function within cihr and the appointment of sds and iab members."
"gc has periodically reviewed the mandates and performance of the institutes through two international reviews, a mid-term evaluation of the institutes and most recently, the institute model review."
"key areas where processes are lacking include: appointment of new sds and transition of the institute to a different host institution; criteria and responsibilities for the review and approval of the application for the isg received from the host institution; responsibilities and requirements for the development of the isg funding agreement; and orientation, including training and awareness on responsibilities, for the new sd and host institute staff."
the documentation that exists to support the transition of institutes and orientation of the sd and host institute staff needs updating.
"currently, these activities primarily rely on corporate memory and informal discussions between ottawa-based institute staff (obis) members."
"in addition, as a result of the most recent institute model review, the obis role will no longer exist as a distinct entity and the staff and their responsibilities will be reassigned to other portfolios."
areas to be addressed include: sd appointment & transition ; hi application review; development of the isg agreement; and orientation of sd and hi staff.
"a) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the audit recommendation for #7a coincides with a key hr deliverable for the 2015-16 fiscal year: hr is assuming responsibility for the activities formerly led by institute affairs, including the recruitment of sd-s, offer/appointment letters, renewal letters, institute transitions and orientation (finance will be responsible for the isg agreements)."
"as part of assuming these responsibilities, hr will lead process mapping and improvement exercises following lean process improvement methodologies to ensure all activities are identified, roles are clarified and efficiencies are implemented."
"formal documentation, assignment of roles, communication of processes will be a part of the change management plan."
the institutes manage records that are part of cihr's information holdings and are subject to the access to information and privacy acts (atip) and treasury board policies.
some institutes have implemented a defined information management records structure.
"the sd is notified of his/her obligations with respect to recordkeeping and atip in their letter of offer and in the newly instated performance plan, but beyond that initial discussion there are currently minimal support mechanisms and controls in place to ensure the proper management of cihr's records."
the planned implementation of infonet and secure access to the cihr intranet for the institutes will improve the institutes- ability to manage information in accordance with gc requirements.
"b) cihr's information management staff should support the institutes through adequate procedures, tools and training on their information management responsibilities, including access to information, privacy and security requirements."
"a) responsibility chief information officer action agreed information management (im) roles and responsibilities will be addressed with the infonet implementation which is scheduled to start in june, 2015. im awareness is part of the infonet implementation strategy."
expected completion august 2015.
b) responsibility chief information officer action agreed the im team is currently updating its im training and awareness materials.
new materials will be posted on the intranet and invitations to training sessions will be sent in the fall.
the im team will ensure that the institutes are part of the communications strategy.
expected completion march 2016.
the responsibility and accountability for support to the sds and institute staff for official languages is not documented (criterion 14).
the institutes are an extension of cihr and represent cihr to the research community and to the canadian public.
"as such, there is an obligation for the institutes to comply with the sections of the official languages act (ola) relating to service delivery (part iv of the act) and the advancement of both official languages (part vii), including consideration of linguistic minority communities."
the responsibilities of the sd in relation to parts iv and vii of the act as described above are laid out in the internal cihr policy on official language.
the obis staff members play a key role in ensuring that institute activities are in compliance with these official languages requirements.
"for examples, when planning a conference, ensuring that all communications and materials are available in both languages."
"gaps in this area could diminish cihr-s ability to engage with its stakeholders, impact cihr's reputation in the scholarly community and with the public, and could result in an official languages complaint against the agency."
"b) sds should be fully informed of their obligations under the ola through documentation, awareness and training."
"a) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the director hr (employee focus) co-chairs the official languages sub-committee with an rkte director (external/community focus)."
an updated official languages policy and action plan has recently been approved by eemc/emc.
the official languages policy clarifies roles and responsibilities.
"formal documentation, assignment of roles, communication of processes will be a part of the change management plan."
expected completion in progress.
"b) responsibility director, human resources action agreed the official languages policy and action plan have been shared with scientific directors at science council."
new scientific directors will receive information about the official languages policy and their role as part of the new integrated onboarding at cihr.
the official languages sub-committee will continue to implement and monitor the official languages action plan.
expected completion in progress.
"current performance reporting for the institutes is comprised of the performance measures defined through the management results reporting structure, and reported in the annual departmental performance report."
the two measures include partner investment in institute-driven research and stakeholder collaboration on institute-driven research.
the institutes also prepare and submit an annual report to governing council.
"the annual reports are focused on the allocation of the $8.6m research funding that is initiated through the institutes, as well as partnerships and total cihr investment in the areas covered by the institute-s mandate."
institute impacts are reported via case studies.
there are neither performance measures nor reporting specific to the outcomes of the isg funding.
"while much of the isg budget is allocated to the costs related to day-to-day functioning of the institute - salaries, office space, equipment, etc. - funding is also used for institute development and engagement of the research community."
a requirement for sds to provide a plan of activities to support their annual isg budget is documented in the letter sent to confirm their appointment.
these should be considered in the context of the performance measures established for the overall institutes and the isi and performance expectations established for the sds.
"a) responsibility director, performance and accountability action agreed cihr is currently implementing the recommendations of the gc institute model review."
"as part of this recommendation, a new framework for evaluating the impact of the institutes is currently being developed."
expected completion june 2016.
"expected completion november, 2015."
"in the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could improve systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to the institute support grants."
we have documented these observations in a management letter and are satisfied with management-s response.
there is no process to ensure modifications to the isg program are assessed for compliance with the isg t&c.
the institute support grant agreement template is not fully compliant with the requirements in the amended terms and conditions and the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments.
"failure to comply with the treasury board (tb) policies for transfer payment programs, the program terms and conditions, and the cihr act could result in reduction of funding, increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders process documentation when an institute transitions requires improvement."
appendix audit criteria and conclusions the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that the institute support grant has moderate issues.
gaps in reporting and monitoring of institute spending have resulted in funds being potentially released to the institutes in advance of need.
"improvements in the documentation of key processes will provide consistency in dealings with the institutes, particularly in light of the dissolution of the ottawa-based institute staff (obis) and reassignment of their responsibilities to other cihr portfolios."
criteria reference to observations
risk and impact cihr is not in compliance with its legislation with respect to the reimbursement of iab member expenses.
"while the financial exposure is limited, given that most institution travel policies are less generous than government rates, the greater risk identified is that there is no defined mechanism to verify program policies and processes against the cihr act."
(table 1 - risk 1) a) the requirement for host institutions to reimburse iab members as per government of canada policy should be documented and communicated to the institutes.
modification to the t&c without the proper authority puts cihr and its senior management at risk of non-compliance with tb policy.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) a process should be established with defined accountabilities and responsibilities to verify all proposed program changes against the isg t&c.
"the process should include review by the relevant offices of primary interest, including legal and finance, to determine the appropriate approval authority in accordance with the policy on transfer payments."
reports are not always received in a timely manner and the expense categories are not always used consistently.
"however, the information is not reviewed or used to make decisions regarding funding the program or to assess funding needs."
"risk and impact this lack of oversight has resulted in cihr not complying with the directive on transfer payments' requirements to fund institutes at the minimum level required to achieve the program goals, and to not pay grant funds in advance of need."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) a monitoring regime with defined accountabilities and responsibilities should be established to ensure financial reports are received by cihr in a timely manner and reviewed as input to program decisions, including the release of future funding."
unspent balances returned to cihr when institutes transition to a new host institution are not handled in accordance with the program t&c and the requirements of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 19g).
the current practice that treats the institute transition as a renewal of the grant and transfers any unspent isg balance to the new host institution is contrary to the t&c.
risk and impact the current process of continuing the isg but changing the grant recipient is not in compliance with the program t&c.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) unspent funds at the end of the grant should be returned to cihr as per the isg agreement and managed and accounted for in accordance with the directive on transfer payments.
"while a template for the agreement exists and is consistently used, the agreement does not currently reflect the complete program t&c and the requirements defined by treasury board for transfer payment programs."
"risk and impact without all of the required elements, the isg program is not fully compliant with the tbs directive on transfer payments."
required elements for funding agreements are defined to ensure funding agreements minimize risks to cihr and enable programs to achieve their objectives.
host institutions may not be aware of all their obligations.
(table 1 - risk 1) a) the isg agreement should be reviewed and updated to accurately reflect the t&c of the program and tb requirements.
the application form for an isg does not contain all the elements as required by the amended t&c (criterion 9).
"in addition, the host institution may not have a clear understanding of its obligations under the isg program."
"however, gaps exist in the documentation of processes to ensure the smooth transition of an institute when a new sd is appointed and the institute moves to a new host institution (hi)."
risk and impact the lack of documentation coupled with the loss of the dedicated support and corporate memory provided by obis staff increases the risk of inconsistency in handling institute transitions.
the sd and institute staff may not receive all the necessary training and information required to fully understanding and comply with their obligations under the isg.
"(table 1 - risk 2) a) the processes, accountabilities and responsibilities in support of key institute activities should be documented or updated if documentation currently exists."
"risk and impact without adequate awareness, training and support regarding their information management responsibilities, the institutes and their sds may fail to protect cihr records, corporate memory may be lost, and the private information of canadian may not be adequately protected or available as required by atip, and the tb policy on information management and directive on recordkeeping."
(table 1 - risk 2) a) sds should be made aware of their accountabilities and responsibilities for managing information created by the institutes.
"although this support requirement is well understood among current obis staff, it is not documented as a responsibility in the obis role profiles, an issue which is exacerbated with the dissolution of the obis roles and re-assignment of staff members within cihr."
"(table 1 - risk 2) a) the responsibilities for supporting the institutes regarding their ola responsibilities should be clarified, documented, and assigned to the new parties responsible once the obis staff has been moved to their new roles."
specific performance measures are not in place for the institute support grant program (criterion 16b).
"risk and impact without specific and meaningful performance and reporting measures for the isg program, cihr's senior management cannot determine how effectively the institutes are using their funding to further institute and cihr objectives."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) cihr should include specific and meaningful performance measures for the isg as part of the regular assessment of institute performance and relevance."
"based on this work, a performance measurement strategy and logic model will be developed which will ensure performance measures for the isg are identified and tracked."
there is no ongoing risk monitoring of the isg program (criterion 24).
"a risk assessment for the isg program was completed as part of the tbs submission for the amended t&c in 2008. it identified three new risks as a result of the changes made to the t&c, along with compensating controls: risk: planned outcomes are not achieved control: on-going monitoring of success control: continued efforts at increasing the resource available for health research control: increasing public knowledge and awareness of value of health research control: program rationalization to focus resources on key priority areas risk: institute transitions, control: institute transition plan risk: misuse of funds no specific actions; considered low risk due to low amount of money (in relation to all funds managed by host institutions) and experience of host institutions in managing grant funds there is no ongoing monitoring of these risks to determine if the mitigating actions have been implemented and are successful, or if the risks need to be updated as a result of changes in the environment."
"risk and impact without ongoing monitoring of the internal and external environment, it is not known if mitigation actions have been implemented, have achieved the desired results or if the identified risks themselves still apply."
"(table 1 - risk 3,4) a) a process should be established to monitor risks to the program on a cyclical basis to determine if: existing risks as defined are still valid; there are additional risks that should be assessed; and mitigating actions for defined risks have been implemented and are effective."
"a) responsibility director, finance action agreed - the framework as described in the response to recommendation 1a) will include: an ongoing risk assessment and monitoring process to ensure all isg program risks are identified, updated and effectively mitigated."
table 1 - analysis of crosscutting risks and impacts the following table maps the audit observations to the identified program risks across observations (horizontally) and further describes the potential impacts to cihr: risk observation mapping to audit specific risk and impacts the policy for payment of institute advisory board member expenses is not in compliance with the cihr act.
unspent balances returned to cihr when institutes transition to a new host institution are not handled in accordance with the program t&c and the requirements of the directive on transfer payments.
the application form for an isg does not contain all the elements as required by the amended t&c.
specific performance measures are not in place for the institute grant support program.
there is no ongoing risk monitoring of the isg program.
decision-making and planning may not be based on accurate and/or sufficient information.
the overall conclusion considers the cumulative risk exposure related to the audit observations in the context of the above criteria.
"deficiencies exist in compliance with policy; however, the non-compliant areas themselves have not resulted in significant exposure."
"the eti governance structure was updated in response to an independent review that was completed in june 2013, as part of the tbs gate 3 approval process."
"for example, there were several levels of joint governance bodies between ssc and the selected vendor."
"this included an executive committee with ultimate project oversight that consisted of the president of ssc, the chief operating officer (coo), a number of senior assistant deputy ministers (sadm), the vendor-s president, a number of senior vice presidents and vice presidents."
governance was also provided through organization-wide governance bodies such as the senior project and procurement oversight committee that provided organizational oversight over all ssc projects.
"a key decision-making body for this project was the sadm eti committee, which was comprised of the ssc sadms and the core project management team."
often the meetings were more of an information presentation.
"within the project team governance, there was an eti implementation steering committee that had a reporting relationship with the project director."
"members of the committee were senior directors from transformation service strategy and design (tssd), projects and client relationships branch (pcr) and operations branch with responsibilities including security, service management and email."
a director general level committee should be used to analyse and potentially approve some project decisions.
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
the baseline costs and savings to be achieved through the implementation of the eti were pulled together with 2009-2010 data that was provided by tbs before the creation of ssc.
"there were constraints and assumptions related to the information, as far as defining and comparing baseline costs for email between departments."
"recommendation 2 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should revisit the assumptions used in the calculation of the baseline costs and ensure a formal audit trail is retained."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
"a rebaseline exercise of all transformation programs, including email, occurred in the fall of 2014. rebaselined costs will be approved by the coo and the president of ssc."
the eti project was a key transformation initiative for ssc.
the eti business case and project charter outlined expectations related to the delivery and outcomes related to the eti.
senior management had been integrated into the governance structure and oversight of the project to ensure the project direction was maintained.
success for the project could ultimately be measured in the successful implementation of the eti solution.
"the eti was being implemented according to the ssc project governance framework, with baseline requirements captured up front and articulated in the project charter and in the contract with the vendor."
"issues related to the project were being managed but were being resolved late, or had yet to be resolved."
issues related to the timing and quality of vendor deliverables had caused an initial 12 week delay and there have been subsequent delays related to sa&a approval.
ssc and the vendor continued to work through the acceptance of deliverables.
"the contract with the vendor stipulated that the vendor would not receive any payments until specific milestones were met, and failure to meet these milestones would result in payment credits."
"during the scope of this audit, no payments were made to the vendor and no credits were received by ssc."
"as of january 31, 2014, key documents had yet to be finalized, such as the functional requirements traceability matrix, which traces the functional requirements outlined for the eti to the design specifications of the build phase, and ultimately the test cases used to ensure the design functions in a manner consistent with the initial requirements."
"the security requirements traceability matrix had also not been finalized, which was a critical document for the overall sa&a process and approval."
"furthermore wave 0 was expected to be completed by april 25, 2014, before final acceptance testing."
this plan was intended to provide an overview of the management of the eti program (email service).
the eti was the first of its kind transformation project for the federal government and also involved a large outsourcing relationship.
"given this, lessons have been learned by ssc that have impacted the timing of the project, this included: issues with connectivity to the vendor data centres; implementation of security requirements; the change in how email will be migrated; slower than expected sorting out and formalizing of documentation; and aggressive project timelines."
"recommendation 3 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure the development of consolidated criteria for the go/no go decision for authorization and deployment."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
the service authorization process includes steps to review these criteria by the service review sub-committee (srsc).
ssc agreed with the recommendation of the independent review and had extensively engaged partner organizations on providing information on the eti project.
ssc was required to understand the level of readiness and potential issues related to readiness that may need to be addressed.
there had been less of an information flow from partner organizations to ssc in terms of ssc understanding partner readiness.
"for instance, key performance indicators related to partner readiness had been developed but as of january 31, 2014, had yet to be completed or reported on for partner organizations."
a process would have made it easier to track which of the partner organizations may have been falling behind.
"when identified, ssc could have provided assistance or guidance to those partner organizations."
ssc was collecting weekly partner status summaries.
several partner organizations raised concerns related to the timing and availability of resources and documents needed to ensure their ability to deploy the solution.
the development of communications and change management material had been very late in the project due both to issues with the quality and timing of vendor deliverables and changes in user engagement.
"for instance, given issues with the email migration method tested by the vendor, a decision to change the data migration method by the project team had only recently been made."
"as of january 31, 2014, draft communication and change management material was just going through the approval phase."
the wave 1 transition documentation outlining the activities required of partners for the implementation of the eti were still undergoing revisions by the vendor.
"recommendation 4 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should develop more systematic approach to partner readiness, with the expected level of partner organization readiness tied to the migration schedule, and an escalation process when partner organizations have not met the expected level of readiness."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
"eti project has developed a more systematic approach to partner readiness and has put in place a process to gather information from all stakeholders including partners, ssc and team bell."
regular meetings between project integration and implementation project managers (pm) and eti partner pms occur on a regular basis to ensure partner readiness.
a monthly partner readiness dashboard has been implemented as a systematic approach to monitor partner organization readiness tied to each project stage.
"in january 2014, an escalation process was developed in order to identify partners that have not met expected level of readiness."
this needs to be supported by change management and communication material.
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
"lessons learned, volume of incidents, and responses to implementation surveys for wave 0 have been gathered and are beginning to be communicated and shared with wave 1 partner organizations in order to help provide them with a smooth transition to the new email service."
the resource model we expected to find a framework in place to ensure relevant business units provided adequate support to the project to support its effective delivery.
coordination and resource allocation between business units and the project team was difficult because of their different perspectives on the level of effort and timing of tasks required to complete the project.
"we also expected that the roles and responsibilities for the eti project had been clearly defined within ssc, and supported by a defined resource model, which included an integrated plan for engagement and use of resources across the enterprise."
"the project team had anticipated a potential gap, and was filling it with contract resources and resources from the operations branch."
"the eti was being implemented according to the ssc project governance framework, which the eti project management described as challenging given its current structure."
tssd took the lead role for the initiation and planning phases.
"pcrb will take the lead for the project execution and deployment (i.e., stage 4 and 5)."
eventually the project will become a program run by the operations branch.
this resulted in stakeholders within business units being unsure of the project-s critical path or their role in ensuring that it was met.
"recommendation 6 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should define the use of the matrix model for transformative projects such as eti, including more formalized processes to ensure a more integrated and transparent enterprise wide project and resource plan throughout its lifecycle."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
ssc is currently restructuring along lines of service.
"resources within a service line will work from planning, to design, to implementation, and finally to operations."
only a small number of high-level assumptions were captured in the project charter.
a number of assumptions were either not captured in detail or were not robustly validated by the project.
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
the contract between ssc and the vendor was complex.
it outlined the requirements for the vendor related to the development and deployment of the eti solution.
"this expectation gap resulted in delays in the project, to both the timing and quality of deliverables being provided by the vendor."
"there were many component pieces of the vendor management function being developed, but no central group had overall accountability to oversee the various aspects of the relationship that was managed by different areas within the organization."
the project team was currently working to determine how the vendor management program would be executed both during and after the transition from the project to the program phase.
"this was an important consideration not just for the eti but for ssc as a whole, given the many other planned transformation projects that will require the management of outsourced vendors."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
this recommendation will be taken into consideration in subsequent complex transformation projects.
procurement strategy is developed prior to request for proposal and is consistent with government of canada guidelines.
"using the input gathered at this stage, ssc establishes its preferred procurement strategy for a particular project through a subsequent request for proposals."
"recommendation 9 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should develop the overall longer term vendor management program for eti, including the identification of the lead unit responsible for the coordination of the program and the relationship with the vendor."
management response: ssc management agrees with this recommendation.
a vendor management unit has been developed within ssc to implement a vendor management program for your email service.
a lead unit responsible for the coordination of the program and the relationships with the vendor has been identified.
the identification of these opportunities for improvement provides valuable lessons for future transformation initiatives.
"this may impact the reputation of ssc as the provider of it infrastructure services to the federal government, and prevent the achievement of the expected benefits from the eti deployment, including cost savings already accounted for."
a director general level committee should be used to analyse and potentially approve some project decisions.
"adm, networks and end user completed in february 2014 the eti dg steering committee was established in february 2014."
"dg, eti completed in february 2014 recommendation 2 the assistant deputy minister (adm), networks and end user should revisit the assumptions used in the calculation of the baseline costs and ensure a formal audit trail is retained."
"management action plan position responsible completion date a rebaseline exercise of all transformation programs, including email, occurred in the fall of 2014."
a revalidation of program transformation costs will be undertaken on a regular basis.
"adm, networks and end user completed in september 2014 recommendation 3 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure the development of consolidated criteria for the go/no go decision for authorization and deployment."
"dg, eti release 1.0 completed in february 2015 recommendation 4 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should develop a more systematic approach to partner readiness, with the expected level of partner organization readiness tied to the migration schedule, and an escalation process when partner organizations have not met the expected level of readiness."
"measures have been put in place for a more systematic approach including the implementation of a monthly partner readiness dashboard, which began to be provided to the project in january 2014. from this dashboard, an escalation process to successive levels of authority is pursued to address outstanding partner implementation readiness issues."
"dg, eti completed in january 2014 recommendation 5 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure those lessons learned by ssc through the wave 0 deployment, including the integration of applications and the resource requirements of deployment, are quickly communicated to wave 1 partners."
this needs to be supported by change management and communication material.
management action plan position responsible completion date lessons learned by ssc wave 0 migration are beginning to be shared with wave 1 partners and other partner organizations.
"for example, a high-level debrief of ssc-s migration experience was provided to the public service management advisory committee on march 27, 2015, as well as with non-partner organizations on april 7, 2015 (heads of it committee)."
the lessons learned being compiled also include the integration of applications (and the availability of the control test environment to test applications) and human resources/service desk resources requirements for migration preparedness.
"each of these elements is being incorporated into change management and communications material, and will subsequently be posted on eti-s gcpedia pages, and communicated with partner project managers as well."
"lessons learned will be gathered from waves 1, 2 and 3 and shared with partners as they prepare to migrate."
"dg, eti completed in april 2015 recommendation 6 the assistant deputy minister (adm), networks and end user should define the use of the matrix model for transformative projects such as eti, including more formalized processes to ensure a more integrated and transparent enterprise wide project and resource plan throughout its lifecycle."
"management action plan position responsible completion date ssc-s realignment along lines of service will help the implementation of the matrix model, for the majority of the projects, by aligning resources of the team under the same branch."
one of the key elements in implementing the matrix model is to clearly define direct and indirect reporting models.
"all contributing teams to a project will indirectly report to the project authority, with clear objectives and deliverables."
"in the matrix model management, performance objectives of individuals and teams will be established by consolidating objectives through the direct and indirect reporting responsibilities."
"this can be assessed during the request for information stages, leading to an eventual request for proposal."
this will allow for a continuous learning cycle.
"adm, networks and end user adm, networks and end user ongoing ongoing recommendation 9 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should develop the overall longer term vendor management program for eti, including the identification of the lead unit responsible for the coordination of the program and the relationship with the vendor."
management action plan position responsible completion date a vendor management unit has been developed within ssc to implement a vendor management program and a lead unit responsible for the coordination of the program and the relationships identified.
these criteria and sub-criteria were agreed to by ssc management at the beginning of the audit examination.
"accountability model - effective approaches are in place to allocate and manage accountability for the project, including accountability of the project manager."
issue management - there is effective control over issue management including tracking and resolution.
role management - clear project roles are established and are effective for the nature of the project.
benefits management - project benefits are clearly documented and an effective approach is in place to track against these benefits.
"direction - effective mechanisms are in place to set and maintain project direction, including the clarity of objectives and alignment to organizational strategy."
delivery - effective mechanisms are in place to support the delivery of the correct project outcome.
acceptance model - an effective approach is in place to obtain acceptance from key stakeholders.
design - requirements are effectively identified and managed to support effective design of the final solution.
"planning - the project is effectively planned at a strategic level so that overall progress can be adequately tracked and course corrections can be made, as necessary."
"scheduling - schedule management is effective; it is clear what tasks are required to achieve the project objectives, in what sequence and with what resources."
managing uncertainty - there is an effective approach to managing uncertainty and ambiguity.
"stakeholder management - stakeholders are effectively managed, including stakeholder both impacting and impacted by the project's activities."
criterion 4 - business unit business unit in this context means the areas of the business within ssc that have a role in supporting the project.
we expected to find a framework in place to ensure relevant business units provide adequate support to the project to support its effective delivery.
business unit support - relevant business units provide adequate support to the project to support its effective delivery.
"criterion 5 - resource management we expected that the roles and responsibilities for the eti project have been clearly defined within ssc, and supported by a defined resource model, which included an integrated plan for engagement and use of resources across the enterprise."
"the eti execution phase governance structure we expected the eti project governance structure to ensure that informed decisions were made, in the correct timeframes, by the appropriate individuals or groups, to ensure the success of the project during the initiation and planning phases."
"we found that a comprehensive governance structure for the eti project execution phase was developed that considered the roles and responsibilities of ssc senior management, central agencies, partner organizations, and the selected vendor for the eti (refer to annex c)."
"the decision-making authority section in the terms of reference for the committee indicated that the committee was meant to review enterprise level issues that could affect the scope, cost or risks of the eti project and to provide direction and decision-making."
"we found the committee met only four times between october 2013 and january 2014 (october 2, 2013; october 31, 2013; november 18, 2013; and january 24, 2014)."
"for example, we found the presentation for the meeting on january 24, 2014, was over 60 pages in length, and there were a number of decisions to be made by the committee, some of which were postponed."
"furthermore, there was insufficient time for committee members to review material before the meetings."
"we found the agenda for the october 31, 2013 meeting indicated that all items were only presented for information."
the committee was meant to review requirements for ssc-provided services and to provide direction and to address risks and issues.
"through interviews, committee members indicated that meetings were more of a status update and forum for the project to brief members of the committee and did not allow for input."
"given the current governance of the project, there was an increased risk that decisions related to the eti were not made in an informed or timely manner thereby impacting the pace or quality of the overall implementation of the eti."
"meetings are scheduled on a bi-weekly and monthly basis, at different management levels, to review the deployment of the eti solution and associated project decisions related to scope, cost and risks."
the baseline costs the eti business case and the project charter indicated an estimated annual savings of $49.9 million (plus the annual $6 million economic action plan savings) would be derived from the eti once the solution was fully implemented by march 2015.
"while there was an awareness of the calculations and assumptions used in some of the calculations, a formal audit trail including documentation of assumptions and constraints did not exist."
"the independent review that was completed in june 2013 as part of the gate 3 approval process indicated that, related to benefits management, -once overall enterprise implementation costs and operating costs are understood, ssc may want to revisit the original business case (taking into account benchmarking of current performance) to validate the business case and provide a basis for on-going project decisions.- ssc partially agreed with this recommendation, although it did not explicitly indicate a plan to revisit and more formally document the baseline costs which were required in order to measure the expected savings."
future potential audits on the eti may question the actual savings achieved as a result of the eti solution if the assumptions and calculations used for the baseline costs are not captured while the knowledge remains within ssc.
"project ownership we expected management to provide an appropriate level of organizational ownership and project direction, including the clarity of objectives, to ensure proper alignment with the organizational strategy."
we found that the eti project sponsors were identified as the sadm tssd and the sadm pcrb.
"critical path items we expected appropriate controls to be implemented to ensure the project could deliver against its objectives, timelines and budgets through project plans and schedules during the initiation and planning phases of the project."
this included ensuring appropriate mechanisms were implemented to ensure due diligence would be conducted prior to the new email solution being deployed within partner organizations.
"the project team indicated that overall requirements for the project had not changed, although there was an expectation gap between the vendor and ssc related to security requirements and deployment plans."
"overall, as of january 31, 2014, the project team indicated there was an extensive amount of review and effort left related to the completion and approval of sa&a documentation for the eti."
"although the date for service authorization remained march 31, 2014, dates related to key critical path items required before service authorization continued to slip."
"sa&a gate 3 approval was scheduled for march 31, 2014, at the same time as service authorization; however, ssc acceptance testing was scheduled to be finalized on april 28, 2014."
"although the program management plan was required within 60 days of contract award (june 25, 2013) by the vendor, it had yet to be finalized."
"the transition plan related to the detailed activities required for partners to prepare and deploy to the new email solution was originally expected to be completed by november 26, 2013, and as of january 31, 2014, was noted in status reports as ""to be determined""."
"a service authorization process has been put in place to ensure that go/no go consolidated criteria are based on the following five lenses: business alignment, architecture, cyber and information technology security, operations, and communications."
based on srsc reviews a go/no go decision is recommended to the coo for authorization and deployment of each service release.
"partner organizations the independent review that was completed in june 2013, as part of the gate 3 approval process, indicated that ssc should document the stakeholder engagement plan (including engagement governance) and accelerate the engagement of key stakeholders within partner organizations."
"it indicated that key areas of the engagement should include implementation and operational resource requirements, as well as organizational change management."
"it was noted that although ssc could engage partner organizations, it was ultimately the responsibility of the partner organizations to ensure they were ready for the migration to the new email solution."
"surveys of partner organizations were conducted by ssc during the initiation phase of the project to obtain a preliminary view of each partner-s readiness in order to determine wave placement, but further formalized surveys or information gathering activities had not been subsequently carried out in relation to readiness."
"for the week of december 20, 2013, the status summary indicated that several issues or requests for wave 1 partners had yet to be addressed."
partner organizations may not have enough specific information to understand the level of effort and timing required to ensure they were prepared for the roll out of the email solution.
"there was no integrated work plan for partner organizations, and there was no evidence that partner organizations had fully integrated the eti into their planning."
"partner organizations may not be ready to deploy the solution, causing delays in the overall implementation of the solution, leading to both a reputational risk to ssc as well as a risk of potentially not realizing the savings that have been projected and already assumed to be taken from ssc-s operating budget beginning april 2015."
"risk mitigation action plans have been developed to resolve implementation issues. recommendation 5 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure those lessons learned by ssc through the wave 0 deployment, including the integration of applications and the resource requirements of deployment, are quickly communicated to wave 1 partners."
"we found that, although senior management was aligned on the overall approach and outcome of the project, the implementation of a matrix model was challenging."
we found that a resource gap had been an issue since the outset of the project.
"mechanisms had not been developed to ensure there was an integrated and enterprise wide approach to ensure the effective utilization of resources for the project across ssc throughout the lifecycle of a project, including those resources that are supporting the current email solution."
"furthermore, an integrated project plan that included resources from across the enterprise was not yet finalized and approved as of january 31, 2014."
"the risk management process we expected that a framework would be in place to ensure project risks had been appropriately identified, captured and reported and mitigation plans developed."
"this included project assumptions being robustly validated and, where required, captured as project risks with appropriate mitigation measures."
the eti had a documented risk management process and a risk register for the tracking of risks.
a review of the risk register for the project execution phase indicated that many risks remained open and the mitigation measures had not been implemented.
"furthermore, the weekly partner status summary for the week of december 20, 2013, indicated several issues or requests for wave 1 partners that had yet to be addressed and may have caused further delays."
these issues had not been captured in the risk register.
"issues were then captured and reported through project governance; however, comprehensive plans to deal with these issues, and to further minimize their ongoing risk to the project, were not observed as part of the project-s risk management activities."
"this risk was closed in august 2013; however, the standard had still not been finalized as of january 31, 2014; and the vendor may not be ready to deliver."
"therefore, they did not have accompanying risk management plans and have resulted in project issues, including: assumptions related to carving out resources from current operational roles to just work on the project were not realized, as the expectations related to the ability to mobilize resources to come to the project were optimistic; the time required to complete detailed and sufficient sa&a activities were underestimated at the outset of the project; assumptions related to the capacity of the vendor being able to provide change management and communication services without major involvement from ssc were not realized; and the ability of the project to perform data migration without requiring a more project-resource intensive server to server migration strategy."
risks related to those assumptions outlined above were not fully captured in the risk register.
"if assumptions are not robustly validated and documented, including determining and tracking the potential risks related to those assumptions and mitigation actions for those risks, this may cause additional project issues. recommendation 7 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure that risk management activities capture all risks and issues and provide suitable mitigation plans against them."
risks and their desired mitigation are a core focus of eti beyond the monthly reporting requirements to treasury board.
"eti believes that proper risk identification and mitigation measures help to maintain project timelines, as solutions are identified and quickly put into place."
"ssc-s relationship with the vendor we expected that the relationship with the vendor for such a large outsourcing deal would be structured as a partnership with shared benefits and risks, and that a vendor management plan would be developed for the management of the vendor after deployment."
"given its complexity, the project team indicated there was an expectation gap between the vendor and ssc, related to security requirements and deployment plans, and that ssc and the vendor continued to work through the acceptance of deliverables."
the project team indicated the contract terms may have caused some of the issues outlined above.
"based on the terms of the contract, the vendor was not paid until completing operational readiness phase 1, and then again at the completion of operational readiness phase 2."
"there were penalties associated with the vendor not meeting these deadlines; however, they were modest in comparison to the overall contract and when compared to penalties found in contracts of benchmarked successful projects of similar complexity."
ssc had not yet determined where the central management function for the ssc-vendor relationship would be positioned in the department.
"without this structure, there was a risk that vendor relations may not be adequately managed."
"recommendation 8 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure that going forward, arrangements with outsourced vendors are more partnership oriented, including sharing of benefits and risks, especially for large and complex transformation projects."
"for example, the request for information process gathers the industry's interest to partner with the government of canada and to share benefits and risks."
"the management of the service provider contract was transferred under the dg, horizontal lead, data centre, in january 2015. conclusion generally, the audit found that control practices related to the initiation and planning phase, as well as the first seven months of the execution phase of the eti, had been implemented and were working as intended."
"opportunities for improvement to strengthen project management and business process controls were noted in relation to project governance, resource management, risk management, readiness of partner organizations and vendor management."
"however, if they are not addressed, they may cause further slippage of deployment dates, deficiencies in the solution or its related controls once it is deployed."
"management action plan position responsible completion date sadm eti committee met at least monthly during the critical phase of the project prior to the deployment of the solution, for key decisions related to scope, cost or risks."
"the committee met on a bi-weekly basis to review and resolve eti-related issues that could affect the schedule, cost or risks of the eti project and it provided direction and decision-making."
management action plan position responsible completion date service authorization for release 1.0 was approved based on the above-mentioned consolidated criteria (the five lenses).
"service authorization process includes steps to review these criteria by the service review sub-committee (srsc) and, based on srsc reviews a go/no go decision is recommended to the chief operating officer for authorization and deployment of the relevant service release."
management action plan position responsible completion date key to a more systematic approach to partner readiness has been the ability of ssc to better identify risks and deficiencies in partner readiness planning.
"adm, networks and end user and dg, eti june 2015 recommendation 7 the assistant deputy minister, networks and end user should ensure that risk management activities capture all risks and issues and provide suitable mitigation plans against them."
management action plan position responsible completion date risks are being managed following the eti risk management process.
"risks are being reviewed on a regular basis and mitigations are identified, tracked and communicated."
"the project conducts bi-weekly meetings to review and escalate project risks and identify, track and communicate proposed mitigations to the leadership team."
"as required, certain, more complicated risks, are presented successively to the eti director general (dg) steering committee, the sadm eti committee, and the eti special project advisory committee."
"dg, eti june 2015 recommendation 8 the assistant deputy minister (adm), networks and end user should ensure that going forward, arrangements with outsourced vendors are more partnership oriented, including sharing of benefits and risks, especially for large and complex transformation projects."
"management action plan position responsible completion date when appropriate and based on future planned initiatives, ssc will ensure arrangements with outsourced vendors are more partnership oriented, including sharing of benefits and risks."
"ssc has instituted a new senior management checkpoint for major procurement activities, which will allow a validation step in the process permitting senior management to assess the risks and assume any residual risks related to a particular procurement."
"dg horizontal lead, data centre completed in january 2015 annex a - audit criteria the audit criteria and sub-criteria used in the conduct of this audit were based on project management standards (pmbok, prince2 and cobit 4.1 po 10) and leading practices of over 2,000 individual project management factors that have been grouped into the specific audit criteria below."
"criterion 1 - governance we expected the eti project governance structure to ensure that informed decisions were made, in the correct timeframes, by the appropriate individuals or groups, to ensure the success of the project during the initiation and planning phases."
"governance approach - appropriate approaches are used to provide governance to the project, including effective ongoing governance and steering committee involvement."
"budgets - the project budget is appropriately established, managed and controlled."
"criterion 2 - ownership we expected management to provide an appropriate level of organizational ownership and ensure project direction, including the clarity of objectives, were alignment to the organizational strategy."
executive support - management provides sufficient oversight and is appropriately engaged and aligned with project delivery.
"criterion 3 - delivery management we expected appropriate controls to be implemented to ensure the project could deliver against its objectives, timelines and budgets through project plans and schedules during the initiation and planning phases of the project."
this included ensuring appropriate mechanisms were implemented to ensure due diligence would be conducted prior to the new email solution being deployed within partner organizations.
resource selection - project resources are appropriately planned and selected.
"resource commitment - project resources are appropriately committed to the project, particularly those deployed from business units."
"criterion 6 - risk management we expected that a framework would be in place to ensure project risks had been appropriately identified, captured, reported, and mitigation plans developed."
this included project assumptions being robustly validated and where required captured as project risks with appropriate mitigation measures.
approach to risks - the approach to manage risk is appropriate given the nature of the project.
"management of risks - risks, including political, stakeholder and reputational risks, are effectively identified and managed."
"criterion 7 - contracting approach we expected that the relationship with the vendor for such a large outsourcing deal would be structured as a partnership with shared benefits and risks, and that a vendor management plan would be developed for the management of the vendor after deployment."
contracting approach - approaches for selecting and contracting with external suppliers are appropriate to reduce risk and ensure alignment with ssc's priorities.
vendor management - relationship with the vendor is appropriately managed to support effective project delivery.
"there is no overall, cihr-wide strategy to measure, monitor and report on detailed learning needs and training performance metrics to inform decision making (criteria 22, 23, and 24)."
there is no systematic effort to analyze overall employee learning needs and training activities for decision making.
the need to monitor and plan for learning is exacerbated by significant limitations in funding of the corporate learning calendar and individual budgets.
expenditure on training at cihr has declined for the past three years.
"in addition, the canada school of public service announced in september, 2014 a mandatory reallocation from all government department learning budgets to fund a central program of training."
"while this will allow cihr employees to access a broad set of online courses at no incremental cost, the reallocation amount ($22,000 in 2014/15, increasing to $44,000 in 2015/16 and $91,000 in 2016/17) was paid solely through the human resources central training budget, reducing the amount available for courses specifically aimed at cihr learning needs."
"as a percentage of the historical average for the corporate learning calendar ($165,000), the mandatory reallocation represents a reduction of 13%, 27% and 56% of the annual budget."
"in particular, the ability to assess and plan for long-term learning and training needs, conduct informed succession planning, identify and mitigate future skill gaps, and the ability for senior management to make decisions about the allocation of scarce training resources, is more difficult and less informed."
"this also results in a lost opportunity for a ""bottom-up"" assessment of training needs from an employee perspective that is independent from that of their supervisors."
"a) the human resources branch should consider establishing a cihr-wide performance management strategy for training, including tracking and reporting metrics to support the decision making process."
"this should include metrics on the assessment of training needs, value for money, and training results."
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will develop a corporate strategy for training that includes the following elements: evaluation of external courses metrics on the assessment of training needs better links with training offered by the research, knowledge translation, and ethics portfolio ongoing tracking of learning in the mygchr human resources tracking system assessing value for money would be difficult due to the limited resources available to administer the learning program as well as the majority of training currently taking place is primarily online and funded through annual payments to the canada school of the public service and ellicom which provide unlimited online training per user."
the application of human resources delegation of authorities is crucial for positions that supervise other employees or make decisions on matters such as hiring and termination.
"the cihr human resources' delegation of authorities instrument delineates the approval authorities for human resource actions, including approving training and leave requests."
no training is provided for the human resources' delegation of authorities instruments.
"cihr training for new supervisors and managers does exist but is rarely delivered, and focuses more on the management of people and ""soft skills"" without addressing legal and policy requirements in the government of canada public service."
this training is also rarely attended by actual first-time managers.
"the canada school of public service offers training for new supervisors and managers that addresses the exercise of human resources delegated authorities, performance management, supervision, as well as general management skills."
"additional training is available for executives, for executive-specific delegation information and executive-level management, and a senior executive level orientation course."
"in addition, the human resources delegation of authorities instrument is not harmonized with the financial delegation of authorities instrument, to which it is complementary, with discrepancies between position titles and incorrect authorities."
"a) new supervisors, managers, and executives should be trained on their responsibilities in exercising human resources authorities."
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will provide training on the human resources delegation of authorities."
a process will also be put in place for ongoing monitoring.
"expected completion march 2016 b) the human resources' delegation of authorities instrument and related materials should be updated to reflect current roles and accountability levels, and harmonized with the financial signing authorities instrument."
cihr requires managers and executives who will hold a budget or exercise financial authorities to take an internal training course on the delegation of financial signing authorities.
"further, the process to track course attendees, verification of which is required to generate a specimen signature record that confirms authority levels, now relies on corporate memory and past specimen signature records rather than an independent list of course attendees."
"it is also possible for budget holders to move into a new position that requires the exercise of a different type of authority (i.e. an employee who only managed an operating budget being moved to a position that controls a granting budget) and not be required to take supplementary training, a ""refresher"" course, or undertake some sort of verification of their ability to understand and exercise these new authorities."
"the treasury board policy on learning, training and development normally requires most new managers and executives in the government of canada to undertake the online mandatory training delivered by the canada school of public service at no incremental cost regarding the exercise of delegated signing authorities."
"while cihr is exempt from this restriction due to its status as a schedule ii/v agency, the policy does consider it good practice for separate agencies to develop their learning, training, and development polices in compliance with the policy."
the policy also requires existing managers and executives to revalidate their knowledge of their delegation of authority responsibilities using an online revalidation tool.
"without a formal record of having attended the delegation of authorities training, there is no independent record of an employee having received the training as a completed specimen signature record indicates holding authorities in the past, not completing relevant training."
"a) employees who exercise financial delegated authorities should be required to take the mandatory, cost-neutral online training offered by the canada school of public service in addition to the cihr customized training."
a) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed the finance branch will require that employees with newly assigned financial delegated authorities complete the online training offered by the canada school of public service.
a process will also be put in place for ongoing monitoring.
"expected completion december, 2015 b) as a best practice in-line with the rest of the public service, employees with financial delegation signing authorities should revalidate their knowledge on a regular basis."
b) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed the finance branch will conduct an annual review of those employees who have been delegated financial signing authorities and require those employees to revalidate their knowledge every 5 years.
a process will also be put in place for ongoing monitoring.
"expected completion december, 2015 c) employees who move into jobs with fundamentally new financial responsibilities should have their delegation of authorities training revalidated to reflect their new responsibilities."
"c) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed any time a new specimen signature record is created as a result of an existing employee moving into a new role at cihr, the finance branch will do a comparison between the old and new record to assess whether that employee will be taking on new financial responsibilities and as such whether they should have their delegation of training authorities revalidated."
"expected completion starting effective october, 2015 d) a separate record of employee delegation of authorities training should be maintained."
d) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed the finance branch will ensure that a separate record of employee delegation of authorities training is maintained and monitored.
"expected completion october, 2015 important learning and training responsibilities defined within the cihr learning program policy have not been assigned to any specific accountability or role with the experience and skills to deliver against those responsibilities (criteria 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 22, and 24)."
there is no position within human resources that has the skills and expertise to deliver on several of the responsibilities currently listed in the cihr learning program policy (cihr intranet link) specifically related to the learning advisor position.
the responsibilities of the learning advisor listed in the learning program policy include: administering and monitoring the learning program at cihr; ensuring that employees and their respective managers are informed of how to register for learning programs; tracking the names of learning program participants; reporting periodically on the implementation of the learning program; advising managers and employees on matters related to learning; seeking feedback and making necessary adjustments to the learning program; and managing the corporate learning budget to the best advantage of cihr.
"in addition to the responsibilities listed in the learning program policy, the duties of the position included: undertaking cost/benefit, economic, and efficiency analyses for internal and external training; identification of common learning needs; long-term planning to meet future learning needs; supporting succession and talent management planning; development and championing of the learning and leadership development programs; maintaining a virtual and physical learning resource center; and researching best practices and excellence in learning and development."
"the position represented a unique confluence of skills and responsibilities that enabled long-term planning for learning needs, and the opportunity to deliver cihr-specific courses using a salaried positon with in-depth knowledge of the organization rather than through the use of contracts with independent training providers."
the position was removed as part of a reorganization in 2012-13 and responsibilities were dispersed within the human resources branch as a result of the deficit reduction action plan.
"the key activities found in the learning program policy and role profile are currently not undertaken, or are performed in a relatively limited manner by existing staff who lack the time and expertise to meet the full potential of the position."
"the position also had the expertise and mandate to assess employee and cihr-wide skill gaps excluding functional specialists, a responsibility which currently resides solely with employee supervisors who may lack a cihr-wide, independent perspective, and the specific skills to undertake such an assessment (see observation 1)."
it is also a missed opportunity to deliver specific and customized in-house training that represents cihr's circumstances and strategic context.
retaining the responsibilities of the learning advisor position in the learning program policy is misleading and obscures which employee is actually accountable for these activities.
"a) all key responsibilities of the learning advisor position should be assigned to accountable positions, taking into account the required skillset necessary to deliver on them."
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed if there is no opportunity to re-establish a learning advisor role at cihr, those responsibilities will be reassigned to the manager, organizational development & planning role."
"expected completion january 2016 b), the learning program policy should be updated to reflect the reassignment of these responsibilities."
"b) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will update the learning program policy to reflect current realities (remove references to learning advisor role and responsibilities and change to the manager, organizational development & planning role)."
"the policy on learning, training and development and related instruments detail who must take mandatory training in the core public service, including new employees and first-time functional specialists."
"cihr is a schedule ii/v agency and is therefore exempt from the requirements of the policy, but despite this cihr adheres to many of its requirements and best practices."
testing a sample of employees hired during the audit period found that not all new employees attended the training.
"the canada school of public service provides cost-neutral courses, often on-line, for a large amount of the required training that is available to all public servants, including employees new to the public service or their roles as functional specialists."
"furthermore, functional specialists have additional legislation- and policy-based compliance requirements that require specific knowledge in order to discharge their duties effectively."
"a) the standard, mandatory cost-neutral training offered online by the canada school of public service for new first-time employees should be required for cihr employees new to the public service."
"a) responsibility chief financial officer/director general, human resources action agreed human resources is developing a new onboarding program that will orient new employees to cihr."
a review of mandatory canada school of public service training offerings will be explored to maximize their value to cihr staff.
"expected completion january 2016 b) as a best practice, new functional specialists should be required to attend the mandatory cost-neutral classroom training offered specific to their positions."
b) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed the directors general of the resource planning and management portfolio will require that employees with newly assigned functional specialist responsibilities complete the specialized training offered by the canada school of public service.
"expected completion december, 2015 c) where possible and when the budget is available, new functional specialists should be provided with the opportunity to attend the fee-based required training that would be mandatory for employees of the core public service."
c) responsibility chief financial officer action agreed the directors general of the resource planning and management portfolio will provide new functional specialist employees with the information pertaining to training courses offered by the canada school of public service in their areas of responsibility.
"expected completion december, 2015 d) as a best practice, it should be mandatory for new employees to commit to attend the government of canada and cihr orientation courses in their performance plans."
d) responsibility chief financial officer action human resources is developing a new onboarding program that will orient new employees to cihr.
a review of mandatory canada school of public service training offerings will be explored to maximize their value to cihr staff.
"the cihr learning program policy specifies that employees may be reimbursed for courses taken outside of working hours, and courses may be prepaid if requested by the manager."
"these courses tend to be for university classes and/or tuition fees, and are therefore relatively expensive compared to other training costs."
a review of files identified several issues or errors related to courses taken outside of working hours.
a) the system for employee departures (ccm mercury) should be modified to ensure the employee departure process includes a review for prepayments.
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed the cihr departure process will be modified to include review for prepayments."
"expected completion january 2016 b) the guidelines for prepayment or reimbursement of training costs should be clarified regarding the payment of late fees, ""ongoing"" courses with no clear end point or final grade, and reimbursement of cihr for incomplete or dropped courses."
"b) responsibility chief financial officer and director general, human resources action agreed human resources/finance will review guidelines for training costs to determine cihr's approach to reimbursement for late fees and ongoing courses."
"expected completion december, 2015 c) a process should be put in place to identify completion dates for prepayments to allow follow-up on the successful completion of courses by employees."
"c) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will review and develop a process for responsibility centre managers to follow-up with employees on completion dates for prepaid training."
"expected completion december, 2015 d) requests for prepayments should be accompanied by evidence that the course was taken at the request of the manager, or the learning program policy should be modified to remove or clarify this requirement."
"d) responsibility chief financial officer and director general, human resources action agreed human resources will update the learning program policy to clarify managerial approval/request requirements."
"expected completion january, 2016 there is no comprehensive process to identify and address the training needs for employees reorganized outside of program delivery positions because of the reforms of open programs and peer review (criteria 2 and 5)."
"in addition, 200 employees were re-mapped within the research, knowledge translation and ethics portfolio to new positions, some of which involve responsibilities separate from program delivery (the position changes are on an interim basis)."
"the corporate learning calendar, which is expected to be the primary mechanism by which employees are trained for non-program delivery duties, is currently in flux with no courses scheduled and was significantly reduced by the canada school of public service mandatory reallocation."
position-level monitoring and support for employees moved out of direct program delivery roles is delegated to their supervisors and budget holders.
"decisions about and support for the training of these employees devolves to the standard performance planning process, without necessarily garnering extra attention or support from the broader organization and management (see observations 1 and 4)."
"the current tools to assess training needs do allow for a broad assessment of a general perception of training needs, and a narrow assessment of specific employee training needs by individual managers, but do not integrate the two or provide an independent assessment of widespread training needs."
the ability to deliver such training is further limited by the reduction in the budget for the corporate learning calendar and the failure to transfer budget to support identified training needs.
"a) employees moved into new positions outside of program delivery roles, where they lack training and experience, should be monitored to determine whether they need and have access to specific and relevant training and the accompanying budget."
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will develop an approach to ensure that relevant training is provided to employees in transition (should form part of observation 1 regarding a corporate strategy)."
"several different types of leave exist, designed to be used for different purposes (e.g. sick leave for illness versus family leave to meet family obligations) with different levels of approval depending on the type of leave."
"four employees took a total of five leaves classified as ""career developmental with pay""."
"the issue is complicated by the fact that the leave is essentially indistinguishable from another type of leave, ""paid leave for training during working hours"" (which can be approved by a manager)."
discussion with the human resources and finance branches could not determine how these types of leave are different.
"in addition to requiring a higher level of approval, career development leave is also accompanied by additional restrictions, such as indicating how the leave supports cihr's learning needs (no explicit discussion was provided for the leave approvals reviewed), and restrictions on overtime and travel costs."
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will review and update the distinctions between leave types."
"expected completion january 2016 the process to develop the corporate learning calendar is not standardized to ensure continuity across years (criteria 2, 7, and 9)."
"for the past three fiscal years, a combination of senior (director general) level and employee-level input was used to develop the corporate learning calendar, but a different process was used for each year."
"the courses offered by the canada school of public service and another source of bulk online training are being used to supplement the resulting reduced budget with unlimited access to online course offerings but they offer unknown benefits for most employees, particularly those with unique or specialized training needs (see observation 7)."
"the canada school of public service mandatory reallocation of funds drastically reduces the scope of customizable or targeted corporate learning opportunities, and the ability to meet broad training needs for the agency as a whole."
this makes the planning of the corporate learning calendar and management of the remaining funds in a judicious and strategic manner more difficult.
a) the process to plan the corporate learning calendar on an annual basis should be reviewed to determine best practices and allow a standardized process to improve year-over-year strategic planning of training needs.
"a) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will adopt a standardized approach to planning the annual corporate learning calendar."
expected completion february 2016 b) the process to review the clc should involve a regular review of the cost-neutral courses to determine if they adequately meet broad training needs at cihr.
"b) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will analyze and report annually on the cost-neutral training taken by cihr staff."
"expected completion march 2016 in the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could improve systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to learning and training."
we have documented these observations in a management letter and are satisfied with management-s response.
appendix audit criteria and conclusions the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
criteria reference to observations
"a variety of mechanisms exist to monitor training at various levels, but several factors impair the ability to report on training broadly: a basic evaluation model exists for in-house training courses, but these results are not combined or used to analyze overall training and no comparable model is used for external courses; the human resources branch produces an annual dashboard which contains broad statements about learning trends and reports a limited set of statistics and targets (percentage of employees attending training, percentage of budget spent on management courses, percentage of employees taking advantage of developmental opportunities), but does not include a more comprehensive analysis of learning and training; there is a lack of communication between the two main sources of learning activities (human resources branch and the training providers in the research, knowledge translation and ethics branch); there is no functional tracking or management system for employee learning (see management letter observation 3); there is no recurrent mechanism to comprehensively assess the specific learning and training needs of employees; the performance planning process uses simple tools to stimulate discussions between employees and supervisors, but the results are not aggregated or used to identify broad training needs; and there is currently no role with the skills, training and mandate to conduct such an assessment (see observation 4)."
"this presents an added risk due to the limited funds available for the shrinking human resources learning budget, which in turn requires better information in order to plan training delivery more strategically."
"during the audit period, several errors regarding human resource actions were identified, including: use of the inappropriate leave types, approved by the wrong level of authority (see observation 8); failing to prepare necessary documentation for an educational allowance for an employee taking educational leave without pay (see management letter observation #1); several training application and authorization forms indicated incorrectly that the training was after hours; several expenditures had limited or no documentation to justify how the training or education linked to the employees' role, future cihr need, or professional requirements; there was no effort or review to prorate reimbursement based on current employee role or future organizational needs; and inappropriate categorization of overtime reimbursements."
the instrument itself has not been updated since 2009.
"b) responsibility director general, human resources action agreed human resources will review and update the delegation of human resources authorities document in consultation with the terms & conditions of employment and the delegation of financial authorities expected completion january 2016 employees with the delegation to exercise financial authorities are not required to revalidate their knowledge on a regular basis, receive only cihr-specific training on their authorities, and are not required to complete additional training when exercising new types of authorities (criteria 8 and 18)."
"while the course is highly customized to cihr's budgetary and approval processes, including how to read and complete internal documents, it does not reflect the broader context of the government of canada or all of the legal and policy aspects of exercising authorities."
"due to staff departure and the change of responsibility for this training, it was not possible to verify that some new budget holders had attended this training before being given a specimen signature record and financial authorities."
cihr does not regularly revalidate authorities.
"risk and impact as agents of the government of canada, budget holders, managers, and executives must meet the legal requirements of the federal accountability act and financial administration act which require, at minimum, awareness of those responsibilities."
"moving into a role with new or fundamentally different financial responsibilities presents a higher level of risk, accountability, and potential for public scrutiny as compared to positions that do not have these authorities."
"the failure to revalidate this knowledge, particularly if it has been years since initial training presents the risk that these responsibilities may not be understood or discharged ineffectively, and employees may not be aware of any policy or legislative changes that impact these duties."
"risk and impact failure to reassign key responsibilities previously carried out by the learning advisor and defined by the cihr learning and training policy to a position with the ability to deliver on these responsibilities appropriately means that the process to plan and deliver training will be reactive, based on a shorter-term horizon, and suboptimal information."
expected completion january 2016 new employees and functional specialists are not required to take government of canada mandatory training (criteria 8 and 17).
"however, while new employees are urged to take in-house orientation training, this training is specific to cihr and focuses on transactional aspects of positions."
"it does not identify and contextualize the array of responsibilities required of federal public servants related to legislation and treasury board policies, including access to information, values and ethics, information management, etc., all of which are critical elements for the discharge of duties by all public servants, including cihr employees."
"similarly, new functional specialists are not required to attend the mandatory training that would be provided for comparable positions within the core public service that informs them of the requirements of their position including compliance with legislation, policies and professional guidelines (new functional specialists are generally provided with on-the-job training, shadowing, and development opportunities)."
"risk and impact employees have responsibilities to meet legal requirements as agents of the government of canada which require, at minimum, awareness of those requirements."
"internal control issues no proof of completion could be located for courses that were prepaid; some prepayments were made directly to the institution rather than the employee, which makes it more difficult to recover funds if the employee does not successfully complete the course; no mechanism exists by which prepayments can be monitored for course completion; and all courses were reimbursed for the full amount, with no justification for lack of prorating, as required by the learning program policy."
"risk and impact employees who receive prepayments can withdraw from the course or leave cihr before completing the course, resulting in a relatively large expenditure that does not benefit the agency."
prepayments made directly to institutions transfers the risks and burden of recovering funds to cihr rather than the employee taking the course.
"while the process to train employees on the changes to program delivery based on the reforms of open programs and peer review is supported by a robust planning, reporting, and monitoring infrastructure, there is no comparable infrastructure or monitoring process for the 17 employees who have been reorganized into new positions outside of the program delivery function."
"the transfer of employees out of the research, knowledge translation and ethics portfolio was not accompanied by a matching transfer of operational funds for training."
"risk and impact transferring employees to new positions outside of their training and experience could risk the employees' success in their new role, delay existing or new projects, and reduce morale."
all types of learning and training leave reviewed were generally appropriate with two exceptions.
"this type of leave is included in the cihr learning program policy, based on the terms and conditions for employment, and is supposed to be approved by a level 3 authority (executive director/director general), but in none of these cases was there evidence of approval by that level of authority."
"overall these types of leave appear to have been requested in error, as ""normal"" training leave would have been appropriate."
"risk and impact failing to distinguish between different types of leave, and the authority needed to approve different types of leave, can lead to confusion and inappropriate approvals."
"a) the distinction between ""paid leave for training during working hours"" and ""career development leave with pay"" should be clarified within the learning program policy, with requirements and approvals commensurate with related risks."
"planning and delivery of the corporate learning calendar is made more difficult given the substantial reduction of the budget caused by the canada school of public service mandatory reallocation of funds, the impact of the reforms of open programs and peer review on the research, knowledge translation and ethics portfolio, reorganization which has delayed the delivery of corporate learning calendar courses in 2015/16, the lack of fully assigned responsibilities under the learning program policy (see observation 4), and the lack of a performance measurement strategy and metrics for learning (see observation 1)."
"risk and impact the year-to-year variation in the planning of the corporate learning calendar makes it difficult to determine if one process is more efficient or effective than another, as well as impairing the ability to plan timelines or compare results across years."
the overall conclusion considers the cumulative risk exposure related to the audit observations in the context of the above criteria.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that learning and training at cihr has significant risks and uncertainties but based on existing controls represents moderate issues.

we conducted our audit in accordance with canadian generally accepted auditing standards.
those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial report.
"opinion in our opinion, the financial report for the administrative costs charged to the canada pension plan account for the year ended march 31, 2015 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the financial reporting provisions in part c of the memorandum of understanding."
"basis of accounting and restrictions on use without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to the fact that the financial report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the above noted memorandum of understanding."
the financial report has been prepared to assist public works and government services canada to meet the requirements of the memorandum of understanding.
our report is intended solely for public works and government services canada and employment and social development canada and should not be used by parties other than public works and government services canada and employment and social development canada.
"signed by ernst & young lpp ottawa, canada chartered professional accountants september 25, 2015 licensed public accountants approved by _________________________________ brigitte fortin assistant deputy minister accounting, banking and compensation branch approved by _________________________________ alex lakroni chief financial officer public works and government services canada introduction a memorandum of understanding (mou) between human resources and skills development canada (now employment and social development canada [esdc]), the canada pension plan (cpp) and public works and government services canada (pwgsc) was signed in february 2015."
"the mou defines the provision of reciprocal services between pwgsc and esdc in terms of level of services, recoverable costs and reporting requirements."
"the mou is in effect from april 1, 2014, to march 31, 2019. postage postage decreased by $531,600 or 13%, compared to previous year."
"this is due to a decrease in the number of cheques mailed to both domestic and foreign destinations, reducing the costs by $1,017,700."
"domestic and foreign cheque volume decreased from 5,938,800 to 4,340,400 and from 584,400 to 536,700, respectively."
"this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average domestic postage rate from $0.61 to $0.71 and in the average foreign postage rate from $0.87 to $1.00, which amounts to $486,100."
"cheques and envelopes cheques and envelopes decreased by $68,300 or 24%, compared to previous year."
"this reduction is mainly due to a lower number of domestic and foreign cheques issued during the year, resulting in a decrease of $67,400."
"a $1,600 reduction is also due to the decrease of the rate for cheques given that a standard cheque size was adopted in the current year."
"the decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in shipping costs, included in the cost of cheques and envelopes."
the recovery of shipping costs started previous year following changes made to the cost recovery practice.
"banking fees banking fees decreased by $147,200 or 7%, compared to previous year."
"this reduction is mainly due to a decrease in the number of cheques issued during the year, which resulted in savings of $183,600 and the rate for direct deposit transactions also decreased, which generated savings of $42,100."
"a slight decrease of foreign traces and recalls of $1,000 also contributed to the decrease."
"this reduction was offset by an increase of $79,500 in direct deposit transactions."
pwgsc paid banking fees on behalf of esdc for payments issued by cheque or direct deposit.
"collateral collateral decreased by $198,600 or 100% compared to previous year."
"until october 2013, collateral charges were incurred for the transfer of funds between the pwgsc account set up for esdc and the consolidated revenue fund at the bank of canada using the large value transfer system."
these costs were paid to scotiabank in accordance with a contract that came into effect in december 2008.
"a new contract was created, and esdc is now billed directly for these costs."
"information technology (it) information technology (it) decreased by $381,600 or 32%, compared to previous year."
"this is due to the disaster recovery costs decreasing by $157,600 due to a change in the methodology when calculating the applied rate."
"also, the printing costs decreased by $224,000 due to the fact that pwgsc-s print centre printed fewer cheques in current year."
"managed secure file transfer managed secure file transfer (msft) increased by $76,600 or 100% compared to previous year."
pwgsc and shared services canada (ssc) implemented the msft service for user departments to transfer files and data to and from pwgsc and the government of canada-s treasury system.
the msft protocol provides a secure data transfer service for electronic information up to the protected b level.
the msft service is provided and supported by pwgsc and ssc.
a fee of $0.0012 per payment has been established to cover the expenses associated with this service.
"direct deposit initiative costs related to direct deposit initiative (ddi) increased by $202,700 or 100% compared to previous year."
ddi was introduced following the federal government-s announcement that paper cheques will be phased out in favour of direct deposit.
"to facilitate the transition from cheques to electronic deposits, pwgsc has invested in communication, system development, information sharing and general operating expenses."
a new rate of $0.0467 per issued cheque has been introduced to cover the ddi.
"reconciliation reconciliation costs decreased by $24,300 or 3%, compared to previous year."
"the decrease is due to a decrease in salary expenses of $77,700 due to the reduction of cheques."
"this reduction was offset by an increase in operating expenditures of $53,400."
reconciliation costs represent service costs for payment redemptions that were directly attributable to cpp payments.
pwgsc-s cheque redemption control directorate provided payment reconciliation and redemption services for cpp payments (both cheques and direct deposits).
"government services government services costs decreased by $21,100 or 11% compared to previous year."
government services costs are the fees incurred to cover employee benefits.
the treasury board rate of 20% was applied to salaries to determine this cost.
"courier services courier costs decreased by $58,300 or 45% compared to previous year."
this decrease is due to a reduction in the number of cheques issued by pwgsc.
"pay services pay services costs decreased by $7,600, or 3% compared to previous year."
this is due to a reduction in the number of related pay accounts within esdc/service canada. pay services costs are the costs incurred by pwgsc in providing pay-related services to employees who administer the cpp within esdc/service canada. pay services costs are calculated by multiplying the number of related pay accounts within esdc/service canada by the average cost per pay account.
"corporate support corporate support costs decreased by $18,700 or 17% compared to previous year."
"lower postage fees and printing needs contributed to lowering the administration fees, as did an overall reduction of costs associated with administering the cpp."
"the financial report has been prepared by management based on the financial reporting provisions in part c of the memorandum of understanding between employment and social development canada and the canada pension plan and public works and government services canada in effect from april 1, 2014 to march 31, 2019. management-s responsibility for the financial report management is responsible for the preparation of the financial report in accordance with the memorandum of understanding, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
auditors- responsibility our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit.
"in making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control."
"an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report."
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
"as a result, the financial report may not be suitable for another purpose."
"because of the complex interplay of the areas of control examined, the audit report is structured thematically, rather than against the specific audit objectives."
"values and ethic framework and formal practices what we expected to find: the foundation of a strong v&e regime is the formal framework that sets direction, establishes accountability and equips all personnel with the information they need to adhere to the v&e requirements."
"the audit expected to find a cohesive, overarching plan for v&e, including objectives and expected results."
"this, coupled with clear governance and accountabilities should form a well-articulated vision and direction for the v&e regime."
"supporting this broad direction, there should be an efficient and clear infrastructure."
"specifically, we expected to find well-developed guidance and training material as well as evidence of v&e considerations integrated directly into decision-making processes."
some are more current than others and some remain in a state of development.
"for instance, until 2012/13, the department had annual v&e plans, which focused on a series of activities being led by labour relations in the hr directorate."
it should be noted that ps-s last v&e plan committed to the development and maintenance of a ps values and ethics program.
we understand that cuts made to the hr directorate as part of the deficit reduction action plan eliminated a position that would have been responsible for this work.
the department has an extremely detailed public service employee survey (pses) action plan which includes numerous commitments.
"the development of a single, outcomes-based vision and plan in relation to v&e would allow these connections to be efficiently and effectively drawn."
"as with any program, the objectives, expected results and vision lay the foundation for success."
this is particularly the case in a program like v&e where responsibility is shared.
"thus, a more fulsome, strategic and aligned approach is required for the setting of v&e direction across the department."
"governance structures and accountability another important foundation for the v&e program is the set of governance structures and related accountabilities that define who is responsible for what, including, but not limited to oversight activities."
"the audit also examined the department-s accountability arrangements in relation to v&e, seeking evidence that there were clear and consistent responsibilities for the v&e program."
of specific concern is the clarity of the responsibilities assigned to the newly established workplace wellness ambassador and co-ambassador.
these individuals are mandated to -encourage ongoing dialogue on values and ethics at public safety canada and [to] establish procedures to allow staff to come forward if they have reason to believe that wrongdoing has taken place and provide protection against reprisal when they do so.- the distinction between this role and that of labour relations is not clear.
unclear accountabilities and channels of communication will only exacerbate this problem.
"codes of conduct & values to determine if employees have specific and clear guidance on their v&e obligations, we examined the adequacy and effectiveness of the codes of values and ethics according to which all employees must abide."
"these, coupled with the guidance and training discussed in the following section, ensure a common understanding of expectations."
"complementing the departmental and public sector codes, the department also has in place four organizational core values (see inset below)."
"through workshops and interviews, the audit sought to confirm that staff clearly understood the values and their day-to-day obligations in relation to them."
public safety canada-s departmental values service: we serve the public.
"we deliver high quality, timely programs and services that are responsive to the needs of all canadians, including our employees unity: we bring people together by building trust through teamwork, collaboration and integration."
"respect: in a diverse society, we demonstrate integrity and respect for each other, our partners, our institutions and canadians, both as taxpayers and as citizens."
"excellence: we are driven by professionalism, innovation, and achieving results for canadians."
our results suggest that while most (94%) of the employees understand the corporate values; there is more limited understanding as to what they mean to employees in their day-to-day work and decision-making.
"while the values are regularly communicated, more work needs to be done to clarify the precise meaning of the values in terms of behavioural expectations (both ideal and prohibited) so that employees understand how they apply at the working level."
even explicit values statements in organizations often turn out to be nothing more than posters or plaques on the wall.
"unless they are formulated in the context of the work that people are doing, and in a meaningful way, they tend to be ignored.- this is particularly the case with unity."
"for instance, a number of workshop participants assumed unity was akin to collaboration, consultation and agreement."
the following graph illustrates the percentage of participants who either strongly agreed or agreed that the values are lived in the department.
"the workshop discussions revealed that there is a common perception that there is a hierarchy of values with some, notably service and excellence, trumping others (i.e., respect and unity)."
"specifically, workshop participants expressed concern that the value of timely service sometimes has to be achieved at the expense of unity and being respectful in carrying out the work."
"departmental values are mutually supportive, not mutually exclusive."
it is important to note that many of the workshop participants expressed a desire to work in a more integrated and collaborative fashion.
"some highlighted the value that networks, like the young professional network, bring to support unity in the organization."
"others expressed frustration that while they make attempts to work cohesively across branches, sometimes the direction of their leaders dictates the opposite."
"training formal training and awareness sessions are provided and comprehensively address the full scope of v&e, with topics ranging from the codes, conflict of interest (coi), harassment and the informal conflict management system (icms)."
training is delivered as part of the orientation for new employees and as part of executive onboarding.
"the department also has specified training on some key topics, most notably the recent training on harassment and violence in the work place, which was mandatory for all employees."
information sessions and online training for directors general and managers/supervisors were provided on managing performance (perform).
content focuses on the importance of departmental values and key expected behaviours as well as the consequences of failing to comply with the codes.
"in summary, we feel the training provided to staff on v&e-related issues is adequate."
"disclosure processes mechanisms such as codes of conduct, departmental values and training all represent important preventative controls, setting direction and increasing awareness and knowledge that help to prevent v&e breaches from occurring."
"these are complemented by detective controls, which help to identify issues or concerns as they emerge, so that they can be addressed and remedied."
among the most important detective controls are the reporting and disclosure channels that are required under the public service disclosure protection act (psdpa).
"of these practices, the senior officer for disclosure is critical."
"as noted earlier under governance, we have concluded that more clarity is needed in accountability and communication of roles."
"in addition to that finding, others related to the department-s disclosure process are provided below."
"first, by way of background, the current disclosure processes include: the mechanisms staff have at their disposal to report real or suspected wrongdoing and, the channels for confidential reporting of conflict of interest, required under the policy on conflict of interest."
conflict of interest: guidance on the reporting of real potential conflicts of interest was well documented and accessible to staff and leadership via the departmental code of conduct and the infocentral web site related to conflict of interest and post-employment.
"wrongdoing: the values and ethics code for the public sector, the ps code of conduct, the departmental disclosure guidelines and the values and ethics webpage on infocentral, all clearly reference the psdpa and articulate the full set of disclosure channel/mechanisms and reporting procedures at the departmental level."
"the collective guidance that is provided references channels such as an employee-s immediate supervisor, the department-s senior officer for disclosure or the public sector integrity commissioner (psic)."
"therefore, more proactive communication of the options for reporting may be needed."
"harassment: as for harassment in the workplace, information and guidance on the reporting and resolution process is available through the departmental code, on infocentral and through the department-s informal conflict management system (icms) services."
workshop data indicates that levels of comfort in using the department-s various channels of disclosure vary.
of participants strongly disagreed or disagreed that those who report/disclose suspected improprieties are protected from reprisal.
"within this group, 88% of middle managers strongly disagreed or disagreed with this statement."
"while the departmental disclosure guidelines clearly specify that employees can use reporting channels confidently and without fear of reprisal, workshop results indicate that the level of trust in these channels is low and that fear of reprisal is high."
the audit also examined comfort with specific reporting channels.
the following graph shows the results.
"while overall individuals were comfortable reporting, some areas of concern exist: workshop participants were comfortable reporting a disclosure to their immediate supervisor (74%) or their supervisor-s boss (58%)."
this is a positive finding as it indicates that the highest comfort level resides in the individual-s immediate work environment.
"having said this, other results presented below suggest that trust, more broadly is a problem."
workshop participants overall have the greatest comfort in reporting issues to a friend or a peer (86%) or through anonymous reporting (66%).
"in a healthy culture, anonymous reporting is not a preferred reporting mechanism, but it is a necessary one to have available."
"it is noteworthy that the department had, to the date of this audit, received no formal disclosures of wrongdoing, but has had one recent anonymous report submitted, which was subsequently investigated."
action plans are presently being developed in response.
"other options such as the public sector integrity commissioner, the chief audit executive and senior officer for disclosure received less agreement (i.e., comfort)."
"the fact that only 50% of participants felt comfortable reporting to the senior officer of disclosure is of serious concern given that this is an important preventative, detective and corrective mechanism."
"in addition, only 49% of participants strongly agreed or agreed that they would feel comfortable reporting a disclosure to hr."
approximately 28% of all workshop participants (all groups) strongly agreed or agreed that they do not feel comfortable reporting a v&e breach.
"of this total group, the data from non-executive groups is of particular concern."
44% of all responding non-executives (not shown in graphic) were not comfortable in reporting through any of the disclosure options.
"the following graphic suggests possible reasons for the discomfort in reporting: positively, a majority of respondents felt that they would be supported by their manager and most knew where they could go if they needed help."
"as reported earlier, the vagueness with which the departmental values are worded contributes to this challenge."
"v&e-based decision making complementing our examination of communications, we assessed the extent to which current governance, decision-making and operational processes were designed to compel adherence to values and ethics requirements."
"operationally, we examined the design of the staffing and grants and contributions processes to see if conflict of interest safeguards were embedded in the business processes."
"in the case of grants and contributions, new and well-designed practices are being implemented on a mandatory basis."
"we also assessed some of the department-s higher-order decision-making processes and expected to see that the processes reflected and compelled the adherence to the departmental values, particularly unity and respect."
"the audit focused on planning, prioritization, pressures management and change management processes related to the realignment initiative."
"these were selected because they are the key points at which leaders must come together as a team, wearing -corporate hats- to make decisions in the long-term and best interest of the entire organization."
"fiduciary responsibility, also known as duty of loyalty, refers to the obligations of the organization-s governors to act honestly and in good faith, with a view to the best interest of the organization."
the audit examined these formal processes to determine if they compelled collaboration and integrative thinking.
"while we have noted positive change since previous audits, some improvements are still needed in these areas."
"as with other findings in this report, the gaps appear to be related both to process and to culture."
"this, coupled with an organizational culture that is already predisposed to siloes makes it extremely challenging to compel leaders to put the organization first, before their own branches."
"recommendations the director general of human resources (dg hr) as the office of primary interest (opi) should consolidate and develop a single v&e frame and action plan that integrates, rationalizes and prioritizes the activities and initiatives that directly or indirectly support the department-s v&e objectives, outcomes and expected results."
consider developing a v&e logic model to map and rationalize the priority activities/initiatives.
"the dg hr as the opi and working with the departmental management committee (dmc) should strengthen formal v&e practices by: further clarifying expectations related to departmental values, including the ways in which they should be operationalized at the working level and the inter-play between them further clarifying and communicating the key v&e roles, responsibilities and accountabilities, including the role of the senior officer for disclosure and the workplace wellness ambassador further clarifying and communicating the departmental disclosure processes, both formal and informal."
"each process will include documenting: the steps to address and resolve workplace issues, the responsibilities of the employee and management, the associated protections available to staff, and the constraints of each process."
mechanisms should be put in place to ensure accountability for the processes working as intended.
"integrate in the consolidated action plan engagement and training related-activities by which to consult with departmental managers and employees to clarify departmental values and expectations of good leadership and management behaviours (e.g. - build on the work the -simple rules- for workplace wellness); communicate and promote best practices to align and support v&e and effective and expected behaviours, v&e roles, responsibilities and accountabilities, and identify and implement discussion forums among exs and among other levels of employees for learning and awareness building and the promotion of effective v&e behaviours, including, but not limited to: information sessions on v&e roles, responsibilities and accountabilities; discussion forums with executives; discussion forums with all employees; introduction of ethical dilemmas of the month with discussion points to assist managers in holding discussions with employees."
"review and clarify for employees, through integrated channels, the role of the senior officer for disclosure and the workplace wellness ambassador, the departmental disclosure process, including the associated protections available to staff."
"march 31, 2016 march 31, 2016 march 31, 2016 v&e monitoring what we expected to find: an important part of any management control framework is the suite of monitoring practices that exist to provide management with insight into the state of performance."
"in the case of v&e, we expected to find robust and regularized processes that track and assess not only the state of the department-s values and ethics (e.g., the -pulse-), but also the effectiveness of the v&e programs and initiatives that enable and sustain strong values and ethics over time."
"as previously stated no single, cohesive strategy or plan exists to proactively define the department-s v&e objectives and expected results."
"by extension, there is no overarching monitoring that is taking place."
"the audit did find that management is monitoring progress against some externally driven initiatives, such as the pses / apex surveys, etc. as well, additional strategies are being developed (e.g., management capacity strategy)."
"by extension, their ability to be proactive and develop effective and efficient solutions to identified problems will also be limited."
recommendations: the dg hr as the opi and working with the dmc should improve v&e reporting and oversight by: reporting regularly on progress against the integrated v&e action plan (noted above in recommendation 1).
developing and tracking formal indicators of the performance and behaviour of leaders in relation to v&e.
"develop, as part of the performance measurement strategy, a v&e monitoring plan of the ex performance management program, to ensure ps values are set out in performance agreements and performance against them is factored in to the evaluation process with the use of formal indicators (i.e. the -how- will be evaluated in equal measure to the -what-)."
"report on first monitoring cycle of 2015-16 in september 2016 implemented for the 2016-17 planning cycle control environment as noted in the introduction of this report, the department-s informal controls, or control environment set the tone of the organization, influencing employees- consciousness of and commitment to controls of all types."
"in this way, the control environment provides the foundation for all other components of the management control framework."
"the control environment includes the integrity and competence of the entity's people; management's philosophy and operating style; the way management assigns authority and responsibility, and organizes and develops its people; and the attention and direction provided by senior leaders-."
"the notion of the control environment is particularly relevant when examining a v&e regime, where individual commitment to the formal v&e practices is critical to their successful implementation."
"our focus was on the following: information and communications: formal and informal messaging from leaders on v&e is an important preventative mechanism, laying out expectations for behaviour and employee commitment that is so important for a healthy v&e regime."
"leadership development: collectively, the practices used to recruit, develop and manage the performance of leaders are integral to developing the -tone at the top- and the -tone at the middle- of the organization."
"as well, leaders- ability to manage their own staff - including delivering tough messages around performance and behaviour - are critical detective and corrective controls, helping to identify, manage and resolve behaviour that may be counter with the department-s v&e expectations."
"accordingly, using a case study approach, the audit examined the department-s realignment process as a corrective control."
"what we expected to find: in auditing these areas, we expected to find evidence that management-s messaging reflects a tone at the top that shows a commitment to control and a clear expectation that all staff will -live- the department-s values and ethics."
"further, we expected to find that these messages drive and are reflected in, the processes used to develop and manage its leaders."
we expected to find evidence that the realignment exercise was being leveraged as a means to adjust and evolve the organizational culture to one which is more management focused.
informal and formal communications information and communications (both formal and informal) were examined to assess the degree to which leaders -talk the talk-.
"as well, the existence and adherence to formal practices that reflect departmental v&e in daily governance and operations were assessed to determine the degree to which leaders -walk the talk-."
examples include regular messaging from the deputy minister and associate deputy minister including the announcement of the realignment exercise and ongoing updates on the exercise that included references to the organizational values.
audit interviews and discussions with the deputy minister and associate deputy minister indicate a strong commitment to the principles of v&e and to addressing known weaknesses.
"while it is important to highlight these strengths, we also note that employees- level of trust in the messages and channels by which they are communicated is very low."
"inter- and intra-branch trust is low and is having a negative effect on employee morale, commitment and their willingness / comfort to raise issues and concerns within the environment."
strong leadership is a key success factor for effective and trusted communications.
"thus, as outlined below, the audit examined the processes in place to recruit, develop and promote strong leaders."
this includes the performance development process for staff and executives.
this is discussed further below.
"recruitment from a recruitment perspective, the department follows the government of canada-s approach to executive staffing, which affords certain flexibilities to the hiring managers under the delegation of authorities under the public service employment act (psea)."
our limited file review noted that leadership competencies were generally only one of many requirements.
"under the current staffing regime, we understand that hr helps support the process and is involved with interviews, but the bulk of the control rests with the hiring manager."
this condition is not uncommon across government where similar challenges exist.
it is important to note that the audit is not suggesting the removal of flexibilities afforded under the psea.
"professional development and talent management once in place, leaders are developed and managed through a variety of means (e.g., training, talent management and performance management)."
among the department-s important leadership development practices are its talent management processes.
talent management is a critical step in leadership development as it helps to establish an effective talent pipeline for the organization.
ps has recently introduced a more formal talent management process that is initiated every fall.
"using tools and guidance from the office of the chief human resources officer, each branch develops and reviews reports on individual leaders, engaging in branch-wide discussions that involve the adms and hr/labour relations."
the deputy minister and the associate deputy minister then meet with adms to discuss talent management and to place all executives on a talent map.
adms are also expected to have one-on-one discussions with each of their executives.
the process as designed also has good oversight as the approved talent management placements are reviewed by the talent management review committee to determine development needs; how to support employees and develop them further; and readiness for lateral or upward mobility.
"the outcomes of the talent management plan include action plans for those whose performance is considered low, talent management plans for -high flyers- and individual learning plans for all executives."
"at this stage of implementation, a dg committee will only be monitoring compliance with the directive and not the quality or the results from the plans."
"complementing the talent management process, in 2013-14, all ps executives (ex-01 to ex-05) were required to participate in a 360-degree assessment and targeted follow up coaching."
"as well, we understand this will not be a recurring process, linked to talent management or performance management of executives."
performance management the final element of leadership development is the process by which their performance is managed.
"this was examined for two reasons: first, to determine if the current performance management practices are adequate to enable and develop v&e-based leadership among existing leaders."
"in the 2013-14 fiscal year, the performance review process placed a heavier weighting on how work was performed including assessing how departmental values are upheld and key leadership competencies, particularly people management, are displayed."
"for this fiscal year and going forward, we understand that if there is a discrepancy between the -results- measure and the -values/leadership- measure, the rating for -values/leadership- is intended to stand as the overall rating and will be reflected in performance pay. in other words, in such situations, high results will not be fully rewarded without a strong demonstration of the ps values and the key leadership competencies."
"it will be important going forward that management overrides not be permitted, to ensure consistency of the process."
"as well, the new performance management process for non-executives (perform) is an important and well-designed control that helps to embed v&e and other behavioural considerations into the performance management regime of leaders."
it builds on the tb directive and the current pmp for executives.
"by design, the new and existing performance management programs and process should result in more effective identification of top talent as well as poor performers."
"if implemented as designed, it should change how performance is assessed and introduce consequences for actions including financial ones."
each of the above-noted improvements to the department-s leadership development mechanisms will help the department.
"but we know that the single biggest predictor of control strength is management-s commitment, willingness and ability to administer the processes as intended."
"in the case of leadership development and people management, this means that managers and executives, as well as the talent and performance management review committees, must be willing and able to have uncomfortable discussions, make difficult decisions and take firm action about behaviour and performance."
only 38% strongly agreed or agreed that they have the willingness.
"over the medium term, an investment in leadership development practices will help to change the culture; but in the interim, additional senior management oversight should be put in place to ensure that the department is truly and genuinely moving towards a culture where leadership and management is valued."
"realignment: an opportunity for cultural transformation using the departmental realignment as a case study, the audit assessed the extent to which it was being leveraged as a corrective mechanism to help reorient the department-s structure and culture towards greater unity, coherence and management-focus."
we have also concluded that the messages and communications around change are in line with and supportive of a commitment to v&e.
"we understand that the initial goal of the realignment was to enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency as well as policy and program integration, over time."
"we further understand that as new issues arose - many of which were related to v&e - the focus of the changes expanded to encompass other priorities (e.g., bp 2020, priorities stemming from recent investigations related to v&e, etc.)."
"continued effort is needed to define the full scope of the realignment initiative and to clearly articulate the desired end state, including the desired changes in culture and behaviour."
this is important to ensure understanding and buy-in to the desired changes.
"during the period of the audit fieldwork, we noted that the branches were working in relative isolation of each other in their management of change."
we further noted that additional opportunity existed to share and apply common concerns and lessons.
"because of this, we were concerned that this approach to change management reinforced siloes, rather than eliminated them."
targeted executive retreats and the formation of a department-wide transformation team are but two examples.
we view these developments positively and encourage such measures to continue.
"such monitoring is critical to ensure common, systemic issues are being identified, managed and resolved, all of which is needed to ensure sustained culture change."
"recent discussions with senior management indicate a positive commitment to regular monitoring, which we understand will take place as part of the transformation team-s scope."
"indeed, the realignment initiative provides management with an ideal opportunity to effect needed cultural shifts."
"further, recognizing that change is a constant, the department should seize any future change initiatives as further opportunities to advance and reinforce cultural dimensions of good management."
"recommendations the dg hr as the opi and working with the dmc should strengthen the control environment by taking a systematic, values-based approach to the recruitment and management of current and future leaders."
"to this end, the department should: reinforce management tools such as statement of merit criteria focusing on leadership, interview questions and reference checks that engage the candidates- peers and subordinates as part of leadership recruitment."
"facilitate access to 360 feedback as an element of employee development, ensuring that the assessors are randomly selected and are protected in terms of their anonymity."
equip leaders with the skills and tools they need to effectively and meaningfully have difficult discussions around performance and reinforce to managers their accountabilities regarding performance management and associated disciplinary actions.
"ensure that leaders- performance reviews are written objectively and are informed by multiple perspectives, i.e. colleagues, labour relations, employees, in order to provide a fair assessment of leaders- interactions, and that performance reviews explicitly reference back to the expectations and targets set out in the pmas, as well as the leadership competencies, to hold them accountable."
"in cases of known performance problems for those in leadership/managerial positions, hold their leaders personally and financially accountable, through their performance ratings, for the management of the former-s performance."
the dg hr as the opi and working with the dmc should support the deputy minister in continuing his positive and targeted communications on values and ethics.
"together with the broader leadership cadre, ensure consistent outreach and change management efforts, taking advantage of the change initiatives underway to help evolve the organizational culture."
"management response management action plan planned completion date development and implementation of generic competency profiles and standardized statements of merit criteria, to be implemented progressively as groups (as, ec, etc.) are completed implement 360 reference checks for promotional appointments to management and supervisory positions."
"implement measures to obtain attestation from hiring managers that their staffing decisions will support ps-s values-based culture and from employees of their commitment to v&e integrate into a staffing monitoring and reporting control framework the monitoring of v&e leadership competencies of ex, management and supervisory appointments."
"due to privacy concerns and logistical constraints of randomly selecting assessors, 360 feedback for employee development purposes will not be pursued."
"identify and implement development initiatives to improve managers- competencies in managing conflict, difficult conversations, and disciplinary actions."
review and update perform training materials targeted to managers to reinforce their responsibilities in managing performance.
review and update guidelines for management teams on the conduct of pmp calibration meetings to ensure and provide guidance on holding leaders accountable for the performance of their employees and on recognizing managers that are demonstrating sound values and ethics in managing performance.
"march 31, 2018 integrate v&e in the departmental communications framework (see recommendation 2) incorporate principles of v&e in the development of communications principles in support of efforts to transform public safety-s culture."
31-Mar-16
v&e directions the audit found evidence that the department has a variety of different v&e-related plans and strategies in place.
the audit found that they were not integrated into a comprehensive or strategic framework or approach nor have shared outcomes been identified.
"however, the plans did not contain any anchoring information such as vision or objectives, or a commitment to monitoring implementation."
"the audit did not find any evidence that the program was ever developed and since 2012/13, there has been no update to the plan."
"more recent initiatives have been put in place to support specific elements that enable v&e, including a management capacity strategy, change management / realignment plans, etc. there are important connections between these initiatives and the department-s v&e priorities, yet at the moment, the department has not drawn them formally."
"the potential impacts of these findings include: misalignment of various v&e roles, responsibilities and activities, which may diminish efficiency or clarity; the pursuit of initiatives that may not directly support v&e and which therefore may not be needed; and greater challenges in monitoring results from investments in v&e and to address risks and gaps before they emerge."
"the audit found that formal departmental governance bodies such as the dmc, human resource management committee (hrmc) and the dac are explicitly mandated to oversee and discuss v&e issues."
"evidence exists that v&e issues and initiatives are discussed, although not on a regularized basis (i.e., not standing agenda items)."
"we found that responsibility and accountability is not clearly enough articulated and documented which poses a risk in organizations like public safety where the organization: has shared responsibility for v&e; is undergoing change; is operating under high pressure to deliver, and is characterized by known issues of mis-trust."
"thus, given these conditions, more formality in accountability arrangements may be required to manage the risk that may come from employees- uncertainty around points of contact or their reluctance to disclose suspected breaches."
"as well, while we understand that the ambassador is considered the senior officer for disclosure, the audit found that the roles, responsibilities and expectations of the ambassadors in relation to this role are not sufficiently clear, nor well enough communicated to and understood by employees."
"in addition, the audit noted that another key player - the departmental champion for the public service employee survey (pses) - plays an important role in v&e matters and directs and oversees a very detailed action plan."
"however, the audit did not find any evidence to suggest formal and systematic linkages between this champion and the new ambassadors."
"as noted later in this report, the audit has confirmed that personnel are not comfortable disclosing v&e breaches."
"while the audit does not feel that all v&e responsibilities need to be centralized in one person or group, we have concluded that greater clarity, alignment and integration of accountabilities and related communication channels is needed."
we found that the departmental code is well understood.
the workshop consultations revealed that the majority of participants indicated a strong understanding of their commitments and obligations in relation to ps-s code of conduct (84% strongly agreed or agreed).
"we also concluded that the code is comprehensive, appropriate for the objectives and risks of the department and in line with the values and ethics code for the public sector."
this is further demonstrated by the extent to which workshop participants agreed that ps core values are upheld in their work environment.
this perception was raised in all workshops and is indicative of the culture and the lack of understanding of the values.
"the above-mentioned training and awareness sessions provide a comprehensive overview of v&e, v&e risks and corresponding obligations."
"key v&e risks and scenarios such as conflict of interest, harassment, violence in the work place and disclosure of wrongdoing are all appropriately addressed."
"the audit found that overall, information on the channels for reporting are relatively well-documented and available to staff, although some improvements could be made in relation to the disclosure process as outlined below."
"however, as noted earlier, easy accessibility to information on the senior officer for disclosure was not in evidence."
"also, despite this training, workshops with staff indicated that a number of participants did not fully understand the full options available to them for disclosure."
"based on the data provided below, we have concluded that there is insufficient trust in the current disclosure channels."
"first, in general: while the majority of workshop participants indicated having a high level of confidence that their immediate supervisor would properly investigate if they reported an ethical breach or wrongdoing (72% strongly agreed or agreed), middle managers (ex minus 1 and 2) were least likely to strongly agree or agree with this statement (33% agreed compared to 67% who disagreed)."
"(note that with the exception of the first bar, responses of -strongly disagree- or -disagree- indicate a lack of comfort; while -agree- or -strongly agree- indicates comfort with the specified reporting channels.)"
participants indicated a lower comfort level rating in reporting a disclosure to the dm/assistant deputy minister (adm).
workshop discussion indicated that this is mainly attributable to the high level of these positions.
workshop discussions indicate that this is because the individuals in these positions are not well known to the participants or the positions were not known as available channels.
"through discussions, participants indicated that hr is viewed as a representative for management, not employees."
"however, we remain concerned by the following results: indicated they thought a disclosure/reporting would limit their future career prospects."
"many workshop participants, particularly those in the non-executive and middle manager level noted that reporting a v&e breach would -follow you- throughout your career, reflecting their view that those who report/disclose suspected improprieties are not protected from reprisal."
did not think it would be investigated properly.
did not think reporting a breach would make a difference.
a number of workshop participants noted that this is because senior management will -close ranks- to protect executives who may be named in disclosures almost 45% indicated that they did not trust the mechanisms available at ps to report a values and ethics breach.
"while the aggregated results are shown in the bar graph above, middle managers (not shown in graphic) had the least amount of trust in the mechanisms (88% strongly agreed or agreed with this statement, i.e., did not trust the mechanisms)."
"through the discussions, most workshop participants indicated that they would be more comfortable reporting what they considered -egregious breaches of ethics-, including conflicts of interest, fraud, theft, etc. indeed, they felt this was their obligation as a public servant, tying this closely to their duty to safeguard taxpayers- dollars and public trust."
"however, in cases of breaches of values, reluctance was higher; in part due to the fact that values are more amorphous than ethics and accordingly, there is a greater -grey zone- in interpreting whether behaviour is appropriate (or not) in relation to the departmental values."
"as well, many workshop participants felt it would be valuable to have an internal resource that could be accessed for advice (on an as-needed-basis) as to whether certain behaviour was appropriate or not in relation to the code of conduct and departmental values."
"we found that for staffing, appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent and detect conflicts of interest."
these are the points at which leaders- adherence to their fiduciary responsibility to the department is most obviously demonstrated.
"it is a notion most widely used to outline the oversight duties of boards of directors; however, the principles of fiduciary responsibility are embedded many instruments of public sector management, including the financial administration act, the values and ethics code for the public sector, the policy on conflict of interest and various elements of the management accountability framework (maf)."
"for instance, in the pressures exercise, the absence of formal and specific criteria to define a departmental priority for funding allowed leaders to pursue their own branch priorities, rather than reflecting on the greatest value for the department as a whole."
"based on the mapping, leverage existing indicators and where necessary consult with senior management on the development of customized, targeted indicators of risk and performance, for use in monitoring and oversight (see recommendation 3 below)."
"management response management action plan planned completion date develop a risk and results-based strategic framework that integrates shared outcomes of the various initiatives related to v&e within the department and that sets out the direction, vision, expected results, responsibilities and accountabilities for an integrated v&e regime."
"as part of the strategic framework and in consultations with exs and dmc members: develop a consolidated action plan; and develop a monitoring and performance measurement framework, including risk assessment and mitigation strategies and performance indicators, to be approved by dmc and informed by actions under recommendation 3. september 30, 2015 march 31, 2016 continue to build on consultations with employees to define -simple rules- for workplace wellness."
"these practices are critical to helping the deputy minister, senior management and hr to stay abreast of risks and issues and to discharge their oversight responsibilities in a timely and meaningful fashion."
"the audit found that while some specific monitoring is being done, it tends to be in relation to externally-driven compliance requirements (e.g., pses, apex survey), rather than against department-specific outcomes."
"while the department did conduct a v&e risk assessment in 2009-10, more recent monitoring of v&e exposures has not been done."
"however, these elements are not sufficiently connected/integrated and therefore do not provide the basis against which cohesive, comprehensive monitoring of v&e risks and performance can be done."
"enhancing the robustness of v&e risk assessment, ensuring these v&e risks are tracked and considered as part of key corporate monitoring mechanisms."
"management response management action plan planned completion date provide semi-annual updates to dmc on progress against the consolidated action plan the associate dm will regularly engage managers and executives, at appropriate committees and fora, to consult on and discuss v&e risks and inform recommendations and follow-up actions."
"establish the means by which senior management will review, assess, and develop mitigation strategies of v&e risks."
the assessment of v&e risks to be informed (but not limited) by the following: development of a monitoring and performance measurement strategy for the obtainment of timely information on areas of v&e risks and performance against indicators.
it will inform the development of the risk-based strategic framework and performance will be reviewed by dmc annually.
information on and an assessment of areas of lr risks in the department.
"as noted in the introduction, the risk analysis conducted during the planning phase, as well as previous audits identified concerns with the state of the control environment, many of which were driven by some specific -cultural- characteristics of the department."
"accordingly, the audit examined the practices that should be in place to manage the risks to an eroding control environment and organizational culture."
"change management: when an organization-s culture or control environment is at risk, an organization-s change management processes are powerful instruments by which an organization can remedy the problems."
"first, on the communications front, we found that the department-s formal messages to staff around v&e are regularly conveyed, consistent and reflective of the government and departmental codes and values."
"departmental values and the code of conduct are broadly communicated; although, as noted earlier in the report, there exists some opportunity to more specifically define the expected (and prohibited) behaviour associated with each of the departmental values."
"workshop and interview consultations indicated that while trusted communications most often existed between staff and their immediate supervisor, the same is not the case with management beyond immediate supervisors."
"we understand that communications are always inherently challenging (i.e., it is difficult to control for style and personality of the communicator and for the reception to the message by staff); nonetheless, we remain concerned that the lack of trust is widespread."
"leadership development practices practices such as recruitment, training and development, talent and performance management are critical preventative, detective and corrective controls against leadership and culture-related risks."
"we have concluded that the department has a number of good practices in place, although some areas of improvement have been identified."
"specifically, there is evidence that some management practices have been or are being put in place to try to compel an appropriate focus on people management capacity."
"however, there is some evidence that the department-s current culture and performance management capacity may be working against the ability of the organization to evolve to a management-focused orientation."
the audit examined the design of the executive staffing processes to determine if it allowed appropriate consideration of leadership competencies and people management acumen in those that were being considered for leadership positions in ps.
"based on our testing, we understand that process, as designed requires hiring managers to assess leadership competencies where appropriate."
"because we did not observe the hiring managers as they were recruiting, we were not able to confirm the emphasis that might have been placed on leadership and management matters in interviews."
"however, we feel that management should consider ways to place additional emphasis on staffing for managerial merit, as opposed to technical, subject-matter expertise."
"additional, risk-based monitoring and oversight by hr of the hiring managers- weightings may be warranted to ensure that the future cadre of managers are competent in people management."
the design of this process is sound as it engages the appropriate parties.
"thus, the audit found that the talent management process is well designed for managing high performers, as well as those that are not achieving their potential."
"while the processes are well designed, the audit found that more explicit attention could be placed on tracking and considering leaders- behaviours as a condition of their advancement."
"as well, there is evidence through the senior level interview consultations that the discussions among senior leaders on the talent management review committee (tmrc) could be more frank and balanced."
"in addition, the talent management guide does not provide any reference to ps-s v&es; although reference is made to the key leadership competencies which are aligned with the public service and the departmental values."
"the audit found that the process is a useful and valuable way to support leadership development, although selecting the assessors randomly would have introduced more integrity into the process."
the audit found clear evidence that the performance management program (pmp) for executives in ps has become better established and that important progress has been made tracking individual and the executive cadre-s performance over time.
"positively, the pmp, which is appropriately integrated with the talent management process described above, requires an explicit and balanced focus on leaders- accomplishments and the means by which they realize them."
we feel this sets a strong and appropriate tone at the top in relation to behavioural expectations of leaders.
the workshop results reveal that many participants felt that leaders did not have the skills and/or the willingness to use the performance management process to appropriately address v&e issues: only 41% strongly agreed or agreed that their leaders have the skills to use performance management process to appropriately address v&e issues.
"it is important to note that this was not a fulsome audit of change management; rather, we examined change management as a mechanism by which known issues of culture were being addressed."
"through our examination, we found additional evidence of strong -tone at the top-, most notably evidenced from the senior attention (dm and associate dm level) that is being placed on leading the change."
"as well, we have noted that appropriate investments - most notably in the form of an external change management consultant - are being made to enable and sustain culture change."
such an evolutionary approach is appropriate and is more efficient than initiating new projects to address each new issue as it emerges.
"however, with such an approach, the risk of miscommunication and staff confusion is increased."
"indeed, the audit found that this risk may be materializing."
"specifically, evidence from interviews and workshops indicated that staff was sometimes unaware of how the various elements of change were inter-related, expressing concerns about coherence and change fatigue."
this increases the risk of staff disengagement.
"we also noted that branch efforts (individually or collectively) were, at the time, not sufficiently focused on desired outcomes."
"however, since the completion of the audit testing, we have seen evidence of branches working more closely together to address common cultural issues."
"thus, we found that progress has been made and attention is being devoted to culture change."
"based on risk, ensure more rigorous oversight of leadership staffing decisions by hr."
"however, it is believed that the intended objectives of developing core competencies in v&e behaviours will be met through the inclusion of v&e in learning and development activities, such as the learning curriculum for managers."
"review and update guidelines for management teams on the conduct of ex pmp calibration meetings to ensure the assessment of leadership competencies, based on formal indicators, and the consideration of multiple perspectives in evaluations."
objective: the terms and conditions of the data-sharing agreements between statistics canada and manitoba health have been met.
the dsas- compliance requirements were only recently communicated to all staff involved in ensuring the confidentiality and security of the statistics canada data.
"authorities, responsibilities and accountabilities should be clearly defined and understood at all levels to support effective management of the terms and conditions (t&cs) of the omnibus data-sharing agreements (dsas)."
authorities are defined statistics canada exercises its mandate to enter into statistical dsas with other organizations under the authority of sections 11 and 12 of the statistics act.
"the directive on data sharing under sections 11 and 12 sets out the roles and responsibilities for the development, implementation and monitoring requirements of dsas."
"the directive notes that information management division (imd), in consultation with legal services, is responsible for drafting data-sharing agreements when requested from directors of statistical programs."
"imd is also required to support managers during the development of new or modified data-sharing agreements with receiving parties, pursuant to section 12 of the statistics act."
subject-matter divisions are responsible for communicating with recipient organizations during the negotiations and drafting the agreements.
roles and procedures related to the management of statistics canada data are clearly established at manitoba health but need to be documented statistics canada confidential information is managed by two branches within manitoba health-the health information management (him) branch and the information systems branch (isb)-as follows: the executive director of him branch at manitoba health has overall responsibility for the life cycle of statistics canada data.
"the manager of management information systems, data management and development, who reports to the executive director, him branch, is the data custodian responsible for managing the dsas and the statistics canada data."
"the database administrator, who reports to the data custodian, performs the duties of data handling, storage, controlling access to the unix server where the statistics canada data are stored, and preparing the transmission of statistics canada to be sent to third parties."
two senior statistical analysts reporting to the director of analytics and research within the him branch are responsible for analyzing statistics canada data and sometimes providing aggregate data to other internal departments as required.
the isb of manitoba health is responsible for the maintenance and security of the unix server.
him branch at manitoba health has been a stable group for a number of years.
"therefore, knowledge transfer and documentation of roles and responsibilities will be a key success factor before her retirement."
"responsibilities of the data custodian prescribed in the dsas have been implemented but a confidentiality document needs to be signed as stipulated under appendix c of the dsas, the data custodian is responsible for the following three key requirements: preparing a confidentiality document and ensuring that all individuals who will access the statistics canada data sign it maintaining a register of data files received from statistics canada maintaining a register of all individuals who have been granted access to the data files."
"appendix c stipulates that the data custodian will -prepare a document for the use of the receiving party-s employees and contractors, outlining the t&cs governing the use of the information, as well as the procedures to send, receive, handle and store the information (hereinafter the -confidentiality document-).- prior to granting access to statistics canada information, the data custodian must ensure that every employee and contractor who will access the statistics canada data has agreed in writing to comply with the terms of the dsas by signing and acknowledging that they have read, understood and agree to comply with the t&cs of the dsa as highlighted in the confidentiality document."
"the audit revealed that a confidentiality document, which outlines the t&cs governing the use of the information, exists and has been signed by all employees who have been granted access to the statistics canada information, with one exception: the data custodian had incorrectly assumed that certain documents signed with statistics canada at the time of becoming the data custodian replaced the need for a signed confidentiality document."
the register of data files received from statistics canada and the register of access granted to statistics canada data files have been implemented and are in use at manitoba health.
the dsas- compliance requirements were only recently communicated to the relevant staff the isb of manitoba health is responsible for the maintenance and security of the unix server where the statistics canada data are stored.
"the isb employees were only recently informed of the existence of the dsas and the security requirements stipulated therein, which could result in a potential breach of the dsas going unnoticed."
"processes exist for activating access to the unix server and for sharing aggregate data with internal departments within the him branch interviews revealed that the creation of a new unix account for new employees is approved by the executive director, him branch, and requested from isb by the database administrator in writing."
"once a new unix account is created by isb, the database administrator has the capability of activating or disabling employees- access to the unix server."
all access to the unix server is logged by the database administrator.
primary users of the statistics canada data within the him branch are two senior statistical analysts.
"the audit revealed that when the analysts request activation of their access to the unix server, the request is made verbally directly to the database administrator without the need for a supervisor-s written authorization."
"because of the close proximity of their offices, the analysts simply walk across the hall to the database administrator-s office and request access."
"while not necessarily a requirement of the dsas, it is prudent practice to implement more formal controls for authorizing access to the statistics canada data."
"the purpose of the analysts- access to the statistics canada data on the unix server is to analyze and provide aggregate data internally within manitoba health, such as when meeting its mandate to participate in the community health assessments that take place every five years."
"interviews revealed that the analysts will sometimes ask a colleague or their supervisor to review the data before they send it internally via email, and the supervisor is copied on the email."
"while not a requirement of the dsas, it would be a prudent practice to obtain a supervisor-s written authorization before the distribution of aggregate data."
manitoba health-s third party agreements include a clause for inspections or audits clauses with respect to monitoring are prescribed by statistics canada in the dsas.
the dsas prescribe that third party agreements entered into by manitoba health -shall contain a clause stipulating the right of statistics canada or the receiving party to review compliance with the terms of this agreement.- paragraph 6.2.4 of the dsas allows manitoba health to share information with the manitoba centre for health policy (mchp) at the university of manitoba.
mchp is not a legal entity in its own right but is a research unit of the university of manitoba and the only third-party recipient of statistics canada data.
"in november 2006, manitoba health signed a contract called -information sharing and protection of privacy agreement- with the university of manitoba, allowing manitoba health to share information with mchp."
"mchp is intended to support manitoba health in coordinating health research, planning, evaluation and monitoring by acting as the focus for a program of data analysis for researching, planning, monitoring and evaluating the provision of health care, emerging health issues and the broader determinants of health primarily in manitoba."
"in addition to the above contract, in october 2014, manitoba health and the university of manitoba signed a letter of agreement specifically for data transfer to and use of canadian community health survey data by the mchp."
the letter of agreement requires mchp to comply with the confidentiality and security requirements of the dsas signed between manitoba health and statistics canada in february 2014; these requirements are attached as appendices to the letter of agreement.
"the information sharing and protection of privacy agreement between manitoba health and the university of manitoba includes an audit clause that allows manitoba health access to mchp-s premises and the authority to inspect, review or audit mchp-s records or information, privacy practices, policies, procedures or security arrangements."
"recommendations the assistant chief statistician social, health and labour statistics field, should communicate with manitoba health and ensure that employees- roles and responsibilities as well as processes and procedures related to the management of statistics canada data under the dsas are documented the data custodian signs a confidentiality agreement as stipulated in appendix c of the dsas the dsa compliance requirements are communicated to all staff involved in ensuring the confidentiality and security of the statistics canada data."
management response management agrees with the recommendations.
the director of health statistics division (hsd) will issue a letter and recommend that manitoba health document the roles and responsibilities of employees and the processes related to the management of statistics canada health survey information.
the director of hsd will request that manitoba health confirm in writing that the data custodian has signed the confidentially agreement.
the director of hsd will request that manitoba health communicate the dsa compliance requirements to all staff involved in ensuring the confidentiality and security of the statistics canada data.
deliverables and timeline: hsd will prepare and send a letter by september 2015.
manitoba health will notify hsd when these actions have been completed.
"data stewardship at manitoba health, processes are in place and monitored to fulfill the requirements stipulated in the data-sharing agreements."
the employees understood and complied with these processes.
internal protocols and controls for the sound management of data should be in place to ensure the protection and safeguarding of statistics canada health survey information over the full life cycle of the information.
these are longstanding employees who are very familiar with their duties.
data files are sent by statistics canada via electronic file transmission (e-ft) directly to the data custodian at manitoba health.
the files are password protected and encrypted during transfer.
"once a data file is received from statistics canada, the data custodian is notified that a file is in the e-ft vault and requests a password from statistics canada to access the file."
then the data custodian sends statistics canada an acknowledgement of file receipt and updates the register of all files received from statistics canada.
the data file is downloaded by the data custodian onto a secure network drive in a separate statistics canada folder designated for the him branch.
the database administrator accesses these files from the network folder and saves them in the unix database where all the statistics canada data are maintained.
the database administrator is the only one who can activate access to the unix server and he or she maintains a register of all access granted to employees.
"third party sharing of statistics canada data all information shared with external parties must be approved by manitoba health-s data custodian, who physically arranges for the transmission of statistics canada data via encrypted cd to the manitoba centre for health policy (mchp) of the university of manitoba."
the database administrator zips and password protects the files on an encrypted cd.
the data custodian then arranges for the delivery of the cd to mchp via bonded courier.
"once the cd has been received by the contact at mchp, he or she must contact manitoba health-s data custodian to obtain a password to open the file."
"furthermore, the him branch requested that mchp perform a similar analysis to assess whether they were also complying with the dsas."
a review of these two analyses showed how each organization met each of the security requirements of the dsas.
this is a document of policies in use at manitoba health to protect sensitive personal information within the organization.
"for example, policy viii: security of personal health information lists the procedures and safeguards in place to protect personal information."
"another is policy ix: corrective procedures to address security breaches involving personal health information, a policy on breaches."
"through it, manitoba health, as a trustee under the phia, can address complaints and conduct investigations related to personal health information security breaches, in accordance with the requirements of phia and the personal health information regulation."
"the policy outlines the steps to be taken under the various types of breaches, how to proceed with a security breach investigation, and what forms to complete."
"if a breach occurs, a security breach reporting form needs to be completed by the branch involved and provided to the assistant deputy minister and the legislative unit, along with the findings of the investigation."
interviews revealed that there have not been any breaches related to statistics canada data.
"the legislative unit of manitoba health provides guidance to the department in ensuring that it is in compliance with the many statutes for which it is responsible, including the phia."
mandatory phia training is provided to all new employees and refresher training to all existing employees every three years.
physical and information technology security logical and physical access controls and procedures exist to safeguard the data in compliance with the data-sharing agreements.
"control and protection of information, either physically or electronically, should be executed in a manner that protects against loss, theft, compromise and improper disclosure."
access to the data should be given only to employees or contractors on a -need-to-know- basis as part of their duties.
logical access controls are in place at manitoba health testing of logical access controls with the database administrator revealed that a password was required to enter into the manitoba government network and a separate password was necessary to enter the unix server where the statistics canada data are maintained.
"the register of user access is updated by the database administrator each time access to the data in unix is granted, as required under the data-sharing agreements (dsas)."
"access to the statistics canada shared folder in the manitoba health network drive should be restricted to those individuals who need access to the statistics canada data when the data custodian receives a data file from statistics canada, the file is downloaded onto a temporary secure network drive in a designated statistics canada folder within the health information management (him) branch directory."
the database administrator accesses the file from the folder and saves it in the unix database where all the statistics canada data are maintained.
"once saved on the unix server, the database administrator deletes the data file from the folder in the network drive."
"normally, the length of time between the files being placed temporarily in the network drive folder by the data custodian and their being deleted from the folder by the database administrator is no more than a day or two."
"upon discovery during the audit, the two files were deleted from the shared folder."
access should be restricted to individuals who need to be involved with the statistics canada data and who have signed a confidentiality agreement.
"physical access is secure statistics canada data resides in two locations at manitoba health-the server room within the information services branch (isb) where the unix server and statistics canada data are stored, and the him branch where the data are accessed."
physical access to the manitoba health premises is controlled by physical card access systems.
each secured area (isb and him branch) is protected by locked doors with card scanners.
staff must swipe their cards to enter the restricted area.
"visitors must sign in at the security desk in the main lobby, obtain a visitor-s card, and be escorted by authorized people at all times."
interviews revealed that security guards are on duty weekly from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. (18 hours) in the main lobby of the manitoba health building.
building security is responsible for monitoring building access and maintaining a register of all visitors.
"when building security is not on duty, the building is locked and only accessible to people with access cards."
access logs are reviewed by building security and there are security cameras in the hallways.
"in the event of employee termination, managers must follow the checklist - departing staff and all access to the systems, as well as physical access to the premises, must be terminated."
"the unix server where the statistics canada data are stored resides in the server room, which is accessed through the command centre."
access to these rooms is limited to approximately 30 isb staff and sometimes to a few registered contractors and vendors.
all visitors upon entry must sign a visitor log located in the command centre.
cameras are positioned outside each of these secure locations to monitor individuals entering these areas.
alarms detect anyone breaking into these rooms and notify building security.
a pass card access log to the command centre is generated and reviewed monthly by isb-s it security officer.
"security measures exist for information copying and retention, and records management policy viii of the personal health information act manual requires that whenever sensitive data are removed from a secure environment, they must be encrypted."
"furthermore, manitoba health-s policy on secondary use and disclosure processes for ad hoc requests states that data can be transmitted only at aggregate levels."
"if quasi identifiers are present, then data must be transmitted via encrypted cd."
statistics canada data cannot be directly accessed or removed from the servers since the servers do not have usb ports.
"the server security includes multiple layers of firewall, choke routers, switchers, intrusion detectors, virus scanning and network monitoring."
"the unix server is backed up daily on encrypted tapes that are housed on site and sent off site each week, to a private storage company."
"there are three levels of data security at manitoba health: public, internal and restricted."
statistics canada data are classified as restricted (highest level of security).
all shredding and disposal of documents is in accordance with restricted information as outlined in the manitoba government electronic media disposal standards and procedures.
a private shredding company is used for the secure disposal of confidential information.
clauses for termination and return or destruction of the shared data no longer in use are included in the dsas as well as in the agreement with the university of manitoba-s manitoba centre for health policy.
"recommendations the assistant chief statistician social, health and labour statistics field, should communicate with manitoba health and ensure that access to the statistics canada folder on manitoba health-s secure network drive is restricted, on a -need-to-know- basis, to employees who have signed a confidentiality agreement in compliance with the terms and conditions of the dsas."
management response management agrees with the recommendation.
the director of health statistics division (hsd) will remind manitoba health of this requirement and request that they take immediate action to ensure that access to statistics canada data is restricted.
deliverables and timeline: hsd will prepare and send a letter by september 2015.
manitoba health will notify hsd when this action has been completed.
appendices
"control environment for the management of the data-sharing agreements while the employees managing the statistics canada data at manitoba health are long-term employees who understand their roles and responsibilities, these roles and responsibilities and the processes and procedures related to the management of statistics canada data under the data-sharing agreements (dsas) are not documented."
the data custodian has not signed a confidentiality agreement as stipulated in appendix c of the dsas.
monitoring of practices as outlined in the t&cs of the omnibus dsas should be in place to detect unwanted disclosures that would otherwise increase operational risk.
there has not been any significant employee turnover in the functions related to the management of statistics canada data and employees understand their roles.
"however, these roles, responsibilities and procedures have not been formally documented."
"while this lack of documentation has not proven to be a problem to date, the audit revealed that the data custodian announced that she will retire in the coming year."
isb must abide by manitoba health-s overall security requirements for restricted information; this reduces the risk of non-compliance with the security requirements of the dsas.
this was not tested as there has not been a new employee requiring access to unix in several years.
"however, there is no formal requirement for the analysts to obtain a supervisor-s approval before the aggregate data are sent."
a review of an aggregate data report provided internally indicated that there were no personal identifiers.
"however, manitoba health has not established a plan to exercise its right to inspect or audit mchp-s compliance."
"management at manitoba health identifies and assesses the appropriateness of existing controls to effectively manage its risks, and responds to and monitors its risk exposure."
"processes are in place and monitored to fulfill the requirements stipulated in the data-sharing agreements the audit revealed that processes, although not formally documented, are in place at manitoba health to fulfill the requirements stipulated in the data-sharing agreements (dsas), and that employees in the health information management (him) branch understand and comply with the processes for the receipt, storing, handling and transmission of statistics canada data."
a risk management process is in place at manitoba health to identify and monitor risks the audit revealed that a risk management process has been implemented at manitoba health over the last two years.
the management services branch is responsible for providing the overall risk management framework to the organization and for supporting the various branches in preparing the risk management section of their annual work plans.
the process entails each branch identifying its risks and the related action plans to mitigate those risks.
"each branch-s executive director and reporting assistant deputy minister must sign a -risk management plan accountability statement to the deputy minister- attesting to the fact that the risk assessment performed has considered all categories of risks, appropriate action plans and mitigation strategies, and that the assistant deputy minister has been debriefed and will ensure that the branch will update its risk assessment cyclically."
"currently, manitoba health-s risk assessment process is at the stage where each branch identifies its risks but they have not yet consolidated the risks from a corporate level standpoint."
there is no risk management committee and no formal corporate risk management policy; this process is still in its early development.
management indicated that they are in the process of considering these tools and evaluating corporate-wide risks.
"management within the him branch is proactive in identifying and assessing risks of non-compliance with the dsas the him branch mitigated its risk of non-compliance with the security requirements of the dsas by performing a thorough analysis of the updated requirements of the new omnibus dsas and, where required, updated their internal operating procedures to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the dsas."
policies and ongoing training exist at manitoba health to mitigate exposure to risk a key document used at manitoba health-one that outlines policies and procedures employees must follow under the personal health information act (phia)-is the phia manual.
"however, access to the statistics canada folder on manitoba health-s secure network drive is not restricted only to those individuals who require access to the statistics canada data and who have signed confidentiality agreements."
the audit testing revealed that two data files had not been deleted from the shared network folder and data were accessible to all individuals within the him branch.
objective 1: statistics canada has established an adequate governance framework to support the quality of justice statistics data.
"governance in support of the quality of justice statistics roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of the key personnel responsible for the quality of justice statistics are well understood within the canadian centre for justice statistics (ccjs) and by key external stakeholders."
several committees have been established to monitor the quality of ccjs data and formal terms of reference outlining their roles and responsibilities have been developed.
"given the number of internal and external stakeholders, a robust governance framework is essential to ensure the quality of justice statistics."
"roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for the quality of data within the canadian centre for justice statistics (ccjs), including the data quality secretariat (dqs), should be clearly documented and well understood."
"the governance structure for ccjs is unique in that it reports not only to internal stakeholders, but also to external stakeholders, through ccjs- membership in the national justice statistics initiative (njsi), which works with ccjs to produce useful information to inform the legislative, policy, management and research agendas of federal-provincial-territorial partners, and the public."
these external stakeholders are important partners in ensuring the quality of ccjs- data and data products.
"as a direct result of the njsi, several governance committees have been established to monitor the quality of ccjs data."
"these governance committees include the liaison officers committee of the national justice statistics initiative and the police information and statistics (polis) committee (a subcommittee of the committee for the canadian association of chiefs of police) and include representatives of the relevant ccjs programs and external stakeholders, such as government and data-provider representatives."
"the committees- membership structure fosters a consistent understanding of data product quality expectations, data definitions and jurisdictional data quality requirements, among others."
this would also provide a mechanism to ensure that key personnel and external stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities and accountabilities regarding data quality.
"the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for the ccjs- data quality secretariat have not yet been formally defined and communicated the dqs was created in 2014 for ccjs to address quality concerns stemming from the fact that specific juristats had to be retracted because of data errors."
"as well, interviewees noted confusion regarding the role of ccjs- dqs versus that of the agency-wide quality secretariat, which recently performed a quality review of ccjs- courts program."
"according to the statistics canada intranet, the agency-s quality secretariat is dedicated to supporting the development and implementation of policies and procedures that promote sound quality management practices, designing and managing studies related to quality management, and providing advice and assistance to program areas on quality management."
"the dqs currently comprises only the chief of the unit, and no other positions within that unit have been staffed."
"in the interim, the work undertaken by the unit is currently being performed by the chief and representatives from the data access and dissemination unit."
"the development of an accountability and governance framework, as mentioned above, would provide an opportunity to outline the roles and responsibilities of the dqs, as well as to formalize how the dqs- role differs from that of the agency-s quality secretariat."
"recommendations it is recommended that the assistant chief statistician, social, health and labour statistics, ensure that a formal accountability and governance framework is developed that outlines the various roles, responsibilities and accountabilities within ccjs and of external stakeholders (including governance committees) responsible for ccjs data quality, and their interdependencies."
"this accountability framework should also include the role, responsibilities and accountabilities of the dqs."
"management response management agrees with the recommendation. the dqs and program chiefs will jointly prepare an accountability framework to be approved by the director, director general and assistant chief statistician responsible for the ccjs, which outlines the internal and external stakeholders- roles and responsibilities, the various committees and their interdependencies."
"to this end, ccjs will build on existing terms of reference of the njsi and that of the polis to harmonize and improve governance and accountability so that roles and responsibilities as well as interdependence are clear."
"a terms of reference document for the ccjs- dqs will also be prepared for approval by the director, director general and assistant chief statistician responsible for ccjs."
the terms of reference will outline the roles and responsibilities of the dqs and its membership.
objective 2: effective control mechanisms have been established and are consistently applied to ensure the release of quality data in accordance with the agency-s quality guidelines.
"control mechanisms over data processing through the development of a national data requirements document and a uniform crime reporting (ucr) incident-based survey manual; the creation of a ucr national training officer; and the ongoing relationship and communications with data providers, the policing services and courts programs are adequately supporting the training and guidance needs of their data providers."
"to improve the reliability, completeness and accuracy of the data, the canadian centre for justice statistics requests that data providers validate their data sets annually before the production of justice statistics publications."
"since both the ucr survey and the integrated criminal court survey (iccs) rely solely on the reception of administrative data from data providers, there is a need for the effective cleansing and verification of the data received through the use of sas-based edit and imputation programs."
"data cleansing and verification processes help detect and correct (or remove) corrupt, duplicate or inaccurate records from a record set. for both the ucr survey and iccs, edit and imputation programs have been developed in conjunction with statistics canada-s methodology branch to achieve the level of quality required for the purpose of the data."
"the statistics canada quality guidelines note that when using administrative data, such as those that are relied upon by the canadian centre for justice statistics (ccjs), the key quality indicators are that data are relevant, accurate, timely and coherent."
controls over the processing of the data received from data providers ensure that the data meet these quality indicators.
"adequate guidance and training should be provided to data providers to support the collection of reliable, complete, accurate and timely data and channels should be established for data providers to communicate any changes to their systems and processes or any changes to administrative data definitions that affect the data provided to ccjs."
"effective data cleansing and verification processes should also have been established to ensure the reliability and relevancy of the data collected, and an effective validation process should have been established to confirm the reliability, completeness and accuracy of the data provided."
"adequate guidance and training is provided to data providers to support the collection of reliable, complete, accurate and timely data in conjunction with data providers, ccjs has developed national data requirements for each of the surveys reviewed."
"they outline the approved data definitions and parameters for each data field required for both the uniform crime reporting (ucr) survey and the integrated criminal court survey (iccs), and are relied on by data providers and program staff to ensure a consistent understanding of the data definitions."
"in addition to the national data requirements, the policing services program has also developed a ucr incident-based survey manual to provide additional guidance to data providers in the discharge of their responsibilities relative to the quality of the data they provide."
"because of the significant number of data providers (over 100 covering over 1,000 policing service detachments) they rely on, the policing services program has further developed standardized training, which is available to all data providers, and created the role of national training officer, whose main responsibilities include providing guidance, support and training to data providers."
"rather, the program relies on their ongoing relationship with their 13 data providers and their participation on the liaison officers committee of the national joint statistics initiative (locnjsi) working group on iccs data quality to provide ongoing guidance and support to data providers."
"data cleansing and verification processes help detect and correct (or remove) corrupt, duplicate or inaccurate records from a record set. for both the ucr survey and iccs, edit and imputation programs have been developed in conjunction with statistics canada-s methodology branch to achieve the level of quality required for the purpose of the data."
"specific to the ucr survey, two types of data providers exist."
"in 2011, to leverage the expertise within statistics canada, the agency-s operations and integration division (oid) started playing a role in processing both ucr1 and ucr2 data."
"specifically, oid is responsible for the data entry of the aggregate counts received by paper by ucr1 respondents and the processing of the data received by ucr2 data providers."
ucr2 data are processed using a sas-based edit and imputation program.
"this program performs data cleansing and verification edits and imputations, and highlights fields that fall outside of expected parameters for verification purposes."
"the processing system will then generate reports logging any edits, imputations or warnings resulting from the processing of the data, called an edit and imputation (e & i) report."
"further, there is currently no requirement for management within the program to review the actions undertaken by the analysts when conducting this follow up with data providers."
"the iccs data, similar to ucr2, are received electronically in the form of microdata, and then processed through a sas-based program."
"again, similar to the ucr2 data, reports are automatically generated by the system to provide ccjs with a summary of the edits and imputations performed by the program and any subsequent warnings that are flagged."
"when deemed material, analysts are following up on the edits, imputations and warnings performed or flagged by the system with the iccs data providers."
"an effective validation process has been established to confirm the reliability, completeness and accuracy of the data provided to improve the reliability, completeness and accuracy of the data, ccjs requests that data providers validate their data sets annually before the production of justice statistics publications."
"as part of the process, ccjs will prepare data tables outlining the data provider-s complete data set for the year, along with explanations of the tables provided and their significance."
data providers are then given a period of time to review the data packages and to provide the applicable ccjs program with any corrections or explanations for unexpected variances.
"once these changes are made, data providers are expected to sign-off on the data set."
"recommendations it is recommended that the assistant chief statistician, social, health and labour statistics, ensure that a standardized process, with relevant tools, is established for the ucr2 as it pertains to the tracking of all edits, imputations and warnings outlined in the e & i reports, including the documentation of consultations with data providers formal parameters are established for the investigation of iccs data edits, imputations, warnings and trends."
management response management agrees with the recommendations.
the ucr survey manager will develop a reference document and log template so that analysts are documenting data quality issues and follow-ups with respondents consistently.
this reference document and log template will be approved by the chief of the policing services program.
"deliverables and timeline: both formalized documents, the reference document and the log template are to be completed by march 2016."
"the iccs survey manager and methodologists are to prepare documentation on the formal parameters and processing reports, which is to be approved by the chief of the courts program."
"the documents will show the formal parameters to monitor edits, imputations and data verification for the iccs."
deliverables and timeline: formalized documentation for the iccs is to be completed by fall 2017.
effective control mechanisms over the production of justice statistics data products help enable the canadian centre for justice statistics (ccjs) to meet stakeholders- quality expectations.
"in accordance with the statistics canada quality guidelines, it is critical to have controls in place to ensure that the data released by ccjs are relevant, accurate, timely and coherent."
"to achieve this, an effective review process should be established to identify and address potential data errors in data products in a timely manner."
"additionally, an effective framework should be established to ensure that any data errors identified post-review are also communicated and addressed in a timely manner."
"ccjs program analysts are responsible for creating the data products and, once completed, the data products undergo a robust internal review process, which includes (1) a peer review whereby all of the data are recalculated and analyzed; (2) a review by the survey manager and program chief, which includes questioning the analysis undertaken by the analyst and any unexpected data trends; and (3) reviews by the chiefs of the other ccjs programs and the director or director general for overall reasonableness of the data and consistency of their appearance with other ccjs data products."
"in addition to the internal review process, to improve the reliability of the data reported, the data products are also submitted to external stakeholders, including data providers for review and validation."
"specifically, the integrated criminal court survey (iccs) juristat is submitted to the associated liaison officers (los) and the uniform crime reporting (ucr) juristat is submitted to police information and statistics committee representatives and the representing los to validate that the information enclosed in the publication appears accurate."
"specifically, statistics canada-s dissemination division has developed an error log to track the errors discovered in released publications."
"this error log includes the results of an assessment of the error-s impact, if the data have been corrected, and the reload date of the publication."
"for some identified errors, a communications plan was developed and maintained to describe the error and its impact, as well as to compare the original data to the revised data and provide a strategy for correcting the error and communicating the impact to the applicable stakeholders."
"once errors have been corrected and publications have been reloaded on the statistics canada external website, an explanation note is included on the website stating the nature of the error that has been corrected and the date the publication was reloaded."
"recommendations it is recommended that the assistant chief statistician, social, health and labour statistics, ensure that pre-release internal and external review processes, as well as the expectations of the reviewer in reviewing data products, should be formally documented adequate documentation should be maintained to demonstrate the conduct of both the internal and external reviews of the data products."
this could include a quality assurance sign-off checklist to be completed by all management levels before data are released.
management response management agrees with the recommendation. the director of ccjs will ultimately ensure that a one-page document on reviewer expectations is developed so that ccjs stays up-to-date on the authority and acknowledgment of confidentiality for advance release for data validation.
"the discussion on the expectations of the reviewer, who is most likely the lo of the national justice statistics initiative, will also take place during the orientation of new los."
deliverables and timeline: a formalized one-page document is to be completed by fall 2015.
the author of each juristat report will be responsible for preparing the log-sheet outlining the comments of the internal and external reviewers and ccjs- responses to the comments.
these log-sheets will be approved by the chief of the analysis unit.
deliverables and timeline: log-sheets will be created and approved continually as reports are published via juristat.
appendices
"a ccjs data quality secretariat was established in 2014, and although it has been working on completing a number of quality reviews, their role, responsibilities and accountabilities outside of this type of direct reporting structure within the ccjs has not been formally defined."
"as well, appropriate and effective oversight bodies should be established to monitor the quality of ccjs data, as it pertains to the internal and external environments of ccjs."
"roles, responsibilities and accountabilities are well understood within ccjs and by key external stakeholders; however, opportunities exist to improve the formalization of their roles, responsibilities and interdependencies a key component of governance structures is the establishment of roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of stakeholders."
"the audit team noted that although the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of the key personnel responsible for the quality of justice statistics seem appropriate and well understood within ccjs and by key external stakeholders, they are not formally documented. rather, the only documentation outlining roles and responsibilities at the personnel-level are job descriptions, which are either generic and do not fully capture all of the roles and responsibilities of key personnel, or are out of date."
"since many of the key personnel within ccjs have been in place for some time and have considerable organizational knowledge, there has not been a perceived need for documenting this."
"however, because ccjs does have a unique and interlinked governance framework that includes oversight at both the departmental level and oversight through the various external partner organizations, there is the potential for overlap or gaps in coverage without a formal accountability framework in place."
"the dqs, which is part of ccjs- data access and dissemination unit, is described in the 2015/2016 ccjs operational plan as a -new secretariat [that] has been formed to carry out data quality evaluations and to support program areas in enhancing data quality procedures.- although the dqs has been working on the completion of a number of quality reviews within ccjs, their role, responsibilities and accountabilities outside of this type of reporting have not yet been well-defined or documented."
"additionally, there is an increased risk of duplication of efforts, especially with that of the agency-s quality secretariat."
"deliverables and timeline: both a formalized accountability framework and the terms of reference documents are to be completed by june 2016. risk management in support of the quality of justice statistics although high-level risks have been identified by the division for the development of the agency-s corporate risk profile, the division-s risk register has not been updated since march 2012."
no formal risk management processes have been developed at either the canadian centre for justice statistics (ccjs) divisional or the individual program level for the identification and assessment of the risks to the quality of ccjs- data and data products.
"additionally, no processes have been established for the development of risk mitigation strategies or the ongoing monitoring of both the risks and the effectiveness of the risk mitigation strategies by divisional management."
"an effective risk management framework needs to be established to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor the potential and emerging risks that may affect the quality of the canadian centre for justice statistics- (ccjs-) data and data products."
"no formal risk management process exists at either the ccjs divisional or individual program level to identify and assess risks posed to the quality of data ccjs management participates in the agency-s risk management exercise, which is to periodically identify and assess the high-level risks facing the achievement of their objectives as part of the corporate risk profile exercise."
"however, no formal risk management processes have been established to regularly identify and assess ccjs- divisional or program-level risks."
"although various documents outline high-level risks facing the ccjs division, the detailed risk register for the division has not been updated since march 2012."
"the chiefs and the director of ccjs are in the process of reviewing and updating the risk register to reflect the risks currently facing the three ccjs programs; however, at the time of the audit, this exercise had not been completed."
"the audit further noted that, although certain risks and issues are being informally mitigated and monitored for each program, no formal process has been established for developing divisional or program-level risk mitigation strategies and their monitoring."
"additionally, no documentation has been maintained as evidence of the ongoing monitoring of the identified risks and the effectiveness of the risk mitigation strategies."
"without a formal process in place for the systematic and ongoing identification and assessment of the risks to the quality of ccjs data and its related products, there is an increased possibility that these potential risks will not be appropriately escalated and mitigated in a timely manner by the (identified) appropriate owner of the risk or risks."
"recommendations it is recommended that the assistant chief statistician, social, health and labour statistics, ensure that the newly formed data quality secretariat (dqs) take on the role of maintaining a formal risk management process for the ccjs that periodically identifies and assesses divisional and program-level risks, as well as handles the development of risk mitigation strategies for continuously monitoring their effectiveness."
"management response management agrees with the recommendation. the director of ccjs will ensure that the dqs will work with the ccjs program areas (policing, courts and corrections) to identify risks and prioritize risk mitigation strategies and action plans for approval by the director, director general and assistant chief statistician responsible for ccjs."
the risk profile and mitigation action plans will be reviewed and updated annually as part of ccjs- operational planning.
the development of risk mitigation strategies and the monitoring of their effectiveness will rest with the ccjs program areas as part of the survey operation.
deliverables and timeline: the ccjs risk profile is to be completed by january 2016.
a formalized document integrating the risk mitigation plan as part of ccjs- operational planning process is to be completed by march 2016.
the effectiveness of the mitigation plan will be reflected within the ccjs- risk profile on an ongoing basis.
"the audit team noted that data providers are consistently signing-off on the reasonability of the data, and when possible, its accuracy and completeness."
"the audit team noted opportunities to further strengthen the expectation of follow-up activities relative to the edits, imputations, warnings and trends for the iccs survey and the documentation of follow-up activities performed with data providers for both surveys."
"given that a representative from statistics canada-s operations and integration division is solely responsible for the data entry of responses received by paper from the ucr1 respondents, the audit team noted further opportunities to strengthen this data entry process through the inclusion of a peer or supervisory data verification review."
the audit noted that both the policing services program and the courts program have established adequate channels for data providers to communicate any changes to either their systems and processes or administrative data definitions that affect the data provided to ccjs.
"specifically, the audit noted that both programs have mechanisms in place to foster strong working relationships with data providers through the locnjsi, the police information and statistics committee and various subcommittees of each, as well as through ongoing contact with individual data providers."
"adequate data cleansing and verification processes have been established to ensure the reliability and relevancy of the data collected; however, verification practices between programs varied since both the ucr survey and iccs rely solely on the reception of administrative data from data providers, there is a need for the effective cleansing and verification of the data received through the use of edit and imputation programs."
"based on a sample of 5 ucr1 and 10 ucr2 selected respondents, it was noted to be a general practice that the data be manually captured by a representative from oid."
"although the audit team noted that some controls have been embedded within the data entry process, such as batch total checks, no peer or supervisory data entry verification is being performed."
"because deletions, edits and imputations performed on the data records can affect the overall quality of the data, the policing services program indicated that follow-up with data providers is deemed critical in addressing certain potential data integrity issues."
"the audit team was able to review evidence of the conduct of follow-up activities performed by the program and oid; however, varying levels of documentation were provided for 7 out of the 10 e & i reports sampled, therefore follow-up activities are not being consistently captured and a standardized process or template for ucr analysts to track the status of these follow-ups with data providers has not yet been developed."
"without the consistent and formal tracking of follow-up activities undertaken with ucr2 data providers based on the results of the e & i reports generated by the processing system, and without the review by ccjs program management of the activities undertaken by the analyst to address data issues, there is an increased risk that follow-up activities may not be performed or issues not remediated per expectations."
"the audit team noted, however, that no formal parameters (i.e., threshold numbers or percentages) have been established for the courts program team responsible for the iccs to trigger when processing edits, imputations, warnings or trends should be investigated further."
"without the establishment of formal parameters (numbers and/or percentages) for the investigation of iccs processing edits, imputations, warnings and trends, there is an increased risk that significant data integrity issues may not be investigated or key data may be deleted from the population, affecting the quality of data products."
"the audit team noted that data providers are consistently signing off on the reasonability of the data, and when possible, its accuracy and completeness."
"based on a sample of 18 data providers for the ucr survey and iccs, all of the annual validation packages were found to be signed off for the year in question."
these parameters should be established based on the impact of a change on each variable on the survey.
"control mechanisms over the production of justice statistics products adequate internal and external review processes have been established to identify potential data errors within draft data products in a timely manner; however, the audit noted opportunities to improve the documentation maintained as evidence of these reviews and how issues and errors were addressed."
"the audit noted that although some evidence was obtained demonstrating that the canadian centre for justice statistics is addressing and communicating errors identified post-review (either pre- or post-release), no formal processes highlighting the steps to be followed and the documentation to maintain when addressing or escalating errors identified post-review have been established."
"an effective review process has been established to identify data errors within draft data products in a timely manner; however, evidence of the conduct of the internal and external reviews is not being consistently maintained once all data providers have signed-off on the data sets, both the courts program and the policing services program use these validated data sets to create data products (via juristat and the daily)."
"although the audit team is satisfied with the level of internal and external reviews, it was noted that an inconsistent level of documentation is maintained to demonstrate the conduct of the internal and external reviews, including how issues and errors have been addressed and resolved."
"no internal formal processes have been established to communicate and remediate data errors identified post-review (pre- and post-release) the processes to be followed in the event of the identification of an error post-review (both pre- and post-release) have not been formally documented. rather, the audit noted that informal processes are being followed when an error is identified internally or communicated by external stakeholders."
"however, the audit noted that for identified errors, inconsistent documentation is maintained to indicate how these errors were communicated, documented and addressed."
"the audit also noted that ccjs is addressing and communicating errors identified post-review, and that the statistics canada directive on corrections to daily releases and statistical products is followed when addressing or escalating errors identified on production day, as well as post-release."
"throughout the audit fieldwork, the audit team observed several examples of how controls are properly designed and applied effectively."
"specifically, the department has developed and implemented privacy breach management policies and processes."
"the department has defined delegation of authorities for the privacy act, and roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within the atip division."
two positions have recently been staffed (september 2014) within the atip division to focus on the further development and implementation of privacy policies and training.
"furthermore, within the areas selected for the audit, access to hardcopy documents containing personal information was well controlled."
these are outlined in the findings below.
"department privacy management framework the audit expected to find a comprehensive and effective pmf implemented within the department, aligned with the requirements of the privacy act and ps and tbs policy requirements."
"while the current ps pmf is evolving and continues to mature, gaps were noted."
"while roles and responsibilities within the atip division have been clearly defined and communicated, job descriptions for some positions in the atip division are out of date and need to be updated which is expected to be addressed through the government of canada (gc) atip community development initiative generic work description project."
program areas do not always consult the atip division regarding the development or inclusion of privacy language in contribution agreements.
"for example, the department provides funding to third parties related to their crime prevention programs and research that takes place to evaluate the efficacy of these programs."
the department has limited the amount of personal information received through these contribution agreements to that of summary level results (without personal information).
"despite this, the contribution agreements do not clearly define the privacy responsibilities of the recipients or the control and custody of the personal information."
it should be noted that the departmental privacy breach guidelines do require program officials to notify atip when a privacy breach occurs.
"at a minimum, program areas that collect personal information should document and retain a rationale for not having completed a pia."
outreach and training the atip division noted that they have not been able to provide training sessions on the privacy act and departmental privacy processes due to resource constraints.
"a draft training plan had been developed which is expected to be implemented in 2015, with the short term training goals to provide awareness sessions to senior management in the spring of 2015 and then rolling out training to the entire department over the next three years."
monitoring a process and corresponding metrics have not been established for the evaluation and measurement of the effectiveness of the implementation of the department-s pmf.
"recommendations the assistant deputy minister portfolio affairs and communications should develop and implement a formal plan, with defined timelines and accountabilities, to address the identified gaps in the department-s pmf."
the plan should address: defining roles and responsibilities related to privacy between functional areas as well as ensuring privacy considerations are embedded within business processes.
formalizing the process for updating pib entries and reviewing pibs so that all personal information holdings used for administrative purposes within the department have a corresponding pib entry in infosource.
the atip division should initially undertake a more comprehensive pib update process to ensure an inventory of all personal information holdings is documented within the department.
this should also consider those personal information holdings used for non-administrative purposes.
establishing departmental policies and guidelines that specify privacy requirements for the development of information sharing agreements and contribution agreements.
the atip division should coordinate their planned training with the baseline training offered by the canada school of public service.
"as part of the training, it should be reiterated that program areas managing personal information should consult the atip division and consider the need to complete a pia."
"in addition, program areas that were identified as collecting and managing personal information without completing a pia should either complete a pia or document a rationale for not doing so."
"establishing a monitoring program with related performance metrics for the evaluation and measurement of the privacy program-s success, and presenting regularly to senior management (e.g. quarterly to the departmental management committee) specifically on the status of key privacy matters."
management action plan planned completion date the assistant deputy minister portfolio affairs and communications will: reiterate that breaches involving personal information must be reported to the atip office.
establish a departmental working group where privacy can be integrated into business processes.
"atip will require branches to identify all personal information holdings in their area of responsibility for both administrative and non-administrative purposes, confirm if a corresponding pib exists, whether the pib needs to be updated, and if none exists, complete a pia to determine if one is required; and ensure that these updates/reviews happened as part of our normal business processes."
develop departmental policy tool/guidelines to assist employees in drafting memorandum of understanding / information sharing agreements or contribution agreements when personal information is involved.
atip to provide advice/training on how to complete pias and revise atip training plan to include focus on targeted areas in the department.
expand on the weekly atip lookahead to include performance metrics.
create a privacy community of practice with the portfolio agencies to discuss common areas of concern and share best practices.
"december 21, 2016 december 21, 2015 december 21, 2016 december 21, 2015 for targeted pia training."
"january 31, 2016 december 21, 2015. controls related to the management of personal information the audit expected to find that the department is managing personal information holdings in compliance with the privacy act and applicable ps and tbs policies."
"additionally, program areas have very long or undefined retention periods for files containing personal information. specific observations resulting from this audit include: csccb retains the files related to itoas and disclosures of criminal records for 10 years."
this includes those files related to requests that have been withdrawn by the requestor (and therefore no decision made).
"the research division within csccb has generally not formally documented retention periods or disposed of any of personal information that is in its custody, and this includes extensive holdings of sensitive personal information related to offenders and criminal records, and research projects that have not been active for a number of years."
"furthermore, having longer retention periods than required increases the resource costs associated with managing the information."
"recommendations each assistant deputy minister should formally document the processes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in those program areas that manage personal information."
this should include clear guidelines related to the use of personal information so that there is a consistent understanding over what constitutes acceptable management and safeguarding of personal information. each assistant deputy minister where applicable should review the retention periods for personal information to determine if the length of time is reasonable and ensure that these schedules are updated as required.
"management action plan planned completion date each assistant deputy minister will, under the framework developed by atip,: develop/document processes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in personal information banks (p.i.b.); develop guidelines related to the use of personal information. march 31, 2017 the assistant deputy minister corporate management will: provide advice on identifying reasonable retention periods for records containing personal information. each assistant deputy minister, in collaboration with the corporate management branch and atip, will: review/update the retention periods; develop a schedule for records containing personal information were retention periods do not exist."
"while secure filing cabinets in the areas selected for audit and peoplesoft access that was tested through this audit were well controlled, audit testing revealed weaknesses in access controls related to rdims and the network drive."
"through audit sample testing, 10 of 25 documents containing personal information that were in rdims had excessive access permissions."
"hence, access to documents is often granted on an individual basis to team members, rather than to user groups, increasing the likelihood of excessive access to documents because as employees leave or change jobs their ability to access historical files often remains unchanged."
"additionally, when user group access is used, it may grant access to employees that should not be privy to the information."
"recommendations each assistant deputy minister, in collaboration with the corporate management branch, where applicable should review the default access settings for documents in rdims that contain personal information."
"management action plan planned completion date the assistant deputy minister portfolio affairs and communications will consistently advises that for documents of a personal nature, access should be strictly on a need to know basis."
the assistant deputy minister corporate management will: communicate rdims access control best practices and will ensure that best practices for access control are reflected in rdims training.
develop a process for monitoring of documents above protected a where excessive access rights have been granted.
"provide advice on corrective action to be taken when excessive access is granted to documents containing personal information. each assistant deputy minister, in collaboration with the corporate management branch and atip, will: develop a protocol to address the accessibility of personal information in rdims, which will include a review of the use of default access settings."
"each assistant deputy minister, in collaboration with the corporate management branch, will: review information on network drives, where applicable, and determine if they must be maintained on the shared drives; ensure that materials are properly relocated to rdims or classified documents system as needed."
"this resulted in several observed strengths, examples of which are listed below: the department has ensured it has appropriate -incident management- practices in place in the event of a privacy breach."
the audit confirmed that privacy breaches brought to the attention of the atip division were handled and followed-up on in an appropriate fashion.
"a policy and processes for the completion of privacy impact assessments (pias) have been implemented, and those pias reviewed as part of the audit were completed and managed in an appropriate manner."
"through the sample access testing conducted during the audit, it was noted that access to personal information within peoplesoft was well controlled."
departmental employees encountered through this audit demonstrated an appreciation for the importance of safeguarding personal information.
the audit team also noted areas for improvement within the existing pmf and specifically for individual branch management practices and processes.
governance and accountability the department has defined appropriate delegation of authorities related to the privacy act.
"although roles and responsibilities for activities within the atip division are clearly established, the privacy roles and responsibilities of the atip division versus other functional areas in the department were not as clearly defined or formally established."
this has resulted in the atip division not being consulted in a number of areas in which their input would have been appropriate.
"furthermore, concerns were noted that program or functional areas may not recognize the atip division as their first point of contact for privacy-related questions, and may instead consult with other groups (e.g., legal or security) within the department or may seek advice directly from the opc."
"examples where roles and responsibilities require additional clarification and formalization include: program areas did not appear to always be aware of the need to consult the atip division on matters such as the privacy implications of agreements/contracts being put in place, or with respect to public interest disclosures (often consulting legal services instead of the atip division)."
"in addition, for the mous that are in place related to information sharing, they are not consistently developed and there was no formalized process for engaging the atip division."
"a privacy breach process has been implemented for the department and audit testing revealed that those breaches reported to the atip division were managed appropriately; however, program areas may not always report breaches to the atip division in order to consult with them to determine if there was a privacy breach."
"furthermore, there was no formalized process for sharing breach-related information from the security operations unit to the atip division."
discussions with the security operations unit highlighted a number of breaches that may have included personal information that had not been reported to the atip division.
"without clearly defined or formally established roles and responsibilities for privacy across all activities within the department and greater clarity in regard to what constitutes personal information or a privacy breach, there is a risk that program areas do not understand the need to consult the atip division, and appropriate privacy practices may not be carried out."
"in addition, the lack of departmental policies and guidelines that specify privacy requirements for information sharing agreements increases the risk that privacy language is not included or consistent within the information sharing agreements, and may result in the parties to the agreement not understanding their roles and responsibilities related to privacy and the safeguarding of personal information."
"risk management for all five program areas that were selected for the audit, personal information being collected were appropriately managed, although for two of the five program areas, pias had not been conducted."
"without completion of a pia in program areas that manage personal information, there is a risk that personal information is not managed in compliance with the privacy act."
"although all the significant personal information holdings identified through the audit had a corresponding personal information bank (pib) entry in infosource, the audit noted some personal information holdings and their uses within those areas were not described through a pib entry, specifically: extradition requests to bring a canadian offender who had left the country back to canada were sent by csc to the csccb for recommendation of ministerial approval; and, royal prerogative of mercy requests to alleviate an individual from their sentence or modify the sentence were sent by the pbc to the csccb."
"without a formalized process for identifying the need for and appropriately updating pib entries in infosource, there is a risk that all personal information holdings across the department do not have a corresponding pib registration in accordance with legislative requirements."
the audit noted that the atip division`s draft training plan could be improved through greater targeting of envisioned training to specific or higher risk program areas that collect and/or manage personal information in order to ensure employees handling personal information receive privacy training in a timely manner.
"a lack of training could result in employees not recognizing privacy issues, not understanding the need to consult the atip division for matters that involve personal information, or not knowing what to do in the event of a privacy breach."
"furthermore the regular monitoring of pi activities and breaches, while done, was not formalized."
a lack of monitoring could result in the privacy program not being implemented appropriately or as intended.
"revising and executing on the training plan to target training to specific or higher risk program areas that manage personal information, and implementing on a timely basis."
"the audit also expected to find that the department appropriately collected, used and disclosed personal information in accordance with the privacy act, including having appropriate authority for collection, limiting collection to what was required for the identified purposes, and ensuring its use and disclosure were consistent with its original collection and limited to that which is necessary."
"without formally documented guidelines and processes for the management of personal information, there is a risk that appropriate practices may not be followed, especially if there are changes in staff within the areas that manage personal information."
"furthermore, formal standard operating procedures are critical to demonstrate to stakeholders and the opc that appropriate processes have been established and are available to support the department should a privacy breach occur."
"the research division within csccb conducts fairly extensive research with sensitive personal information. specific operating procedures have not been formally established for research activities, although staff indicated that leading practices related to the management of personal information for research purposes were informally followed (i.e., tri-council policy) ."
"in addition, it was noted that there are no standard operating procedures or guidelines on privacy considerations, including entering into mous, collecting personal information, and matching or linking personal information for research purposes."
"ccirc retains information indirectly received through the course of researching cyber incidents for 10 years, although social insurance numbers (sin) are immediately deleted, and financial information is deleted if it is identified."
retaining personal information for longer than required increases the risk that the information may be inappropriately used or disclosed and may be considered a privacy breach.
"march 31, 2017 safeguarding of personal information the audit expected to find appropriate security measures in place to ensure that personal information is appropriately protected and access is restricted."
"based on the audit work conducted, the main repositories for files containing personal information within the department are rdims, peoplesoft, the network drive, and secure filing cabinets."
files containing personal information saved in rdims are not always appropriately secured across the department.
"while the number has decreased in all branches over the last year, there has been no formal follow-up on these documents as the directorate-s focus has been on ensuring classified documents are being saved appropriately in the classified version of rdims rather than in the non-classified version of rdims."
"the audit noted that within the research division within csccb, a large volume of sensitive personal information is being stored on network drives."
"furthermore, a number of shared services canada (ssc) employees had access to the folder given their role as system administrators, and files did not have further restrictions such as passwords or encryption."
"this should include the implementation of monitoring activities related to rdims access rights, and a process for follow-up and mitigation when excessive access rights are granted to documents containing personal information. each assistant deputy minister, in collaboration with the corporate management branch, where applicable should review any instances in which program areas are storing personal information on the departmental network drives in order to: determine if the use of the network drive for the storage of the personal information is appropriate; review and ensure access is limited to only those individuals that have a requirement to access the information; and, based on the sensitivity of the personal information, determine if additional controls should be implemented (e.g., file encryption) given that personal information stored on network drives may be accessible by network administrators, including network administrators with ssc."
"march 31, 2017 the assistant deputy minister corporate management will: provide advice on transferring this information into rdims; and, review the list of shared drive exceptions where program areas are still using network drives; develop recordkeeping agreements with each program area using a shared drive; and, establish a monitoring process to ensure appropriate use of shared drives."
"delete files off network and work with it to permanently close them off; and, where applicable, review network policies to ensure appropriate use of files containing personal information. march 31, 2017"
the icfr framework document will be updated to clarify the objective and better separate the scope of internal control management and icfr.
this will provide more direction when conducting ongoing monitoring of icfr assessments.
"march 2016 director, financial controls and accounting services adm corporate services should ensure: the sampling methodology is revised to include the determination of whether a statistical test is required for icfr assessment reports, standardized statistical terminology, and guidance on acceptable error rates and sample sizes for random sampling; and the rationale for the scope of testing in the cyclical assessment is adequately documented including providing an explanation for the exclusion of certain sub processes within a business process."
the icfr assessments will include an explanation for the exclusion of certain sub processes.
16-Mar
completion date for each action) opi direct report for each specific action adm corporate services should revise the tc internal control over financial reporting framework for risk-based assessment and monitoring document to clearly define the objective and scope specific to icfr testing and to differentiate it from that of internal control management.
"march 2016 director, financial controls and accounting services as part of the cyclical assessment of icfr, the adm corporate services should ensure that: tools and processes related to risk control matrices are further standardized and documented; and direction is provided with respect to how fraud is considered when business processes are assessed."
"additional guidance and direction will be added to the risk and control matrices, including how fraud is to be considered."
the icfr framework will be updated to: identify a sampling approach based on consideration of what approach is needed; consistent use of standardized statistical terminology; and guidance on acceptable error rates and sample sizes for the sampling approach selected.
"in addition, the icfr framework will be updated to reflect that key controls are not necessarily present in every business sub-process."
"in order to provide reasonable assurance that an adequate process is in place to effectively support the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions, we expected to find the following: a management framework that is in place to support the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions."
"the requirements, roles and responsibilities concerning application of the tb guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are defined and communicated."
work tools have been developed to support the cfo attestation process.
a due diligence review fulfilling the requirements of the guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions that is performed when required and properly documented.
the main conclusions related to the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions are conveyed in a letter attached to the cabinet submissions.
management framework audit objective: provide reasonable assurance that an adequate process is in place to effectively support the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions. findings criterion 1 a management framework is in place to support the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions.
"sub-criterion 1.1: the requirements, roles and responsibilities concerning application of the tbs guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are defined and communicated."
the requirements as well as the roles and responsibilities concerning application of the tbs guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are defined and communicated in the csa guide to costing (cgc).
"the approach for costing a project is divided into seven steps, and cfo attestation is the final step."
"the cgc describes the general information regarding the assertions that are evaluated, the due diligence review to be performed, and each player-s role."
"also, a new csa guideline for cabinet submissions is currently being developed."
"this new guideline will help to not only formalize the csa-s cabinet submission process, but also to communicate the players- roles and responsibilities in the cfo attestation process."
"we conclude that the requirements, roles and responsibilities concerning application of the tbs guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are defined and communicated."
sub-criterion 1.2: work tools have been developed to support the cfo attestation process.
these standardized work tools are used to guide the costing and due diligence review processes.
"as for the due diligence review form for the project, it provides good guidance to the financial analyst who carries out the due diligence review in keeping with the guideline on cfo attestation requirements."

"condition conclusion about the criterion: a due diligence review fulfilling the guideline-s requirements was performed for all cabinet submissions examined, and they were all properly documented."
"also, the main conclusions related to the cfo attestation process are communicated in a letter attached to the cabinet submissions, as required."
"sample a sample of five cfo attestations for cabinet submissions, from a total of 11 attestations made between january 1, 2014 and june 30, 2015, was selected and examined."
the selection criteria for the projects were as follows: relative importance individuals assigned to the due diligence review nature of the space/non-space activities branches the examination sought to determine whether the due diligence review had been performed in a way that fulfilled the requirements of the guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions.
these analyses are supported with communications and detailed working papers showing that a thorough due diligence review was carried out to evaluate the assertions.
this evaluation is supported with references to relevant documentation and/or an argument related to the professional judgment of the financial analysts.
a file is set up by the finance directorate to document the due diligence review process performed for each cfo attestation.
the file is saved in a separate directory on the csa-s network and contains the documents used and produced during the attestation process.
important written communications with managers are also saved in that directory.
sub-criterion 2.2: the main conclusions related to the cfo attestation process are communicated in a letter attached to cabinet submissions.
each of the five project files that were audited included an attestation letter that meets the requirements of the guideline on cfo attestation.
"for each of those letters, the cfo-s opinion is clearly stated and presents the observations and conclusions of the due diligence review process."
causes n/a effect n/a recommendation n/a responsibility identified organization n/a function n/a management response n/a management action plan action plan details deadline n/a n/a
"the analyses carried out to support cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are appropriate, sufficient and well documented."
condition conclusion about the criterion: our audit found that a management framework is in place to support the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions.
"the former official documented process was several years old and did not include cfo attestation, which was not mandatory at the time."
we found that work tools have been developed and are used to support the cfo attestation process.
"as for the cost spreadsheet, this tool is sometimes adjusted based on the type of project or program in order to meet specific needs."
"the selected sample consisted of the following: three space exploration branch projects for which the budget was sizable one space utilization branch project one corporate services branch project of a non-space-related nature sub-criterion 2.1: the analyses performed to support cfo attestation for cabinet submissions are appropriate, sufficient and well documented."
"for each file examined, the observations and conclusions provided in the due diligence review form for the project demonstrate that an appropriate and sufficient analysis was carried out to support cfo attestation."
"a number of questions on the assumptions, costs and risks associated with the project are sent to managers by the financial analysts."
the general conclusions address each assertion and are based on the evaluation of multiple criteria and sub-criteria.
"the files are all structured in a similar way, as follows: project charter, costs, risks and contract."
we found that the main conclusions related to the cfo attestation process for cabinet submissions are communicated in a letter attached to the cabinet submissions.
"the attestation letters officially communicate the six assertions based on the text of the standard assertions set out in annex a of the guideline on cfo attestation for cabinet submissions, and they are signed by the cfo, as required by the guideline."
"roles, responsibilities and procedures for effective decision making we expected ssc to have documented and communicated the roles and responsibilities for effective decision making as found in the treasury board of canada secretariat management accountability framework (maf)."
the executive committee tors were available to employees via ssc-s extranet.
tors were approved by either the delegating committee or the committee itself.
there was also no clear expectation as to how changes to the tors were to be approved.
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure that committee terms of reference (tor) are approved by the decision-making authority delegating the authority to the committee and that the tors include dates and versioning information."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be circulated by the executive committees group periodically to committee chairs for review by each committee and then to the president of ssc for final approval.
"the pgof required the involvement of the smb, sppoc and btc as part of its documented approval process."
"recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure consistency with the decision-making authorities stated in ssc-s project governance framework."
decision-making process we expected to find a documented decision-making process for decisions made in the committees.
"none of the executive committees- tors stated whether decisions were by majority vote, consensus or decisions were to be made by the committee chair alone."
not having a documented and communicated decision-making process could lead to confusion and unclear committee accountability.
only the smb documented what constituted a quorum for holding a meeting and the dvmc documented the requirements for a quorum for decision making.
"recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should establish and document decision-making processes for each of the executive committees, including quorum."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be updated to include the decision-making process as well as the accountability reporting structure. quorum will also be specified.
decision-making tools we expected that tools would be in place to support effective committee decision making.
"for example, the average attendance for each committee reviewed was as follows: smb 90%; cmc 75%; sppoc 95%; btc 76%; oc 68%; and osrc 85%."
we also found that items were not accurately categorized in the agendas.
"for example, nine of 25 agenda items were identified as being -for information- or -for discussion-, but resulted in documented decisions being made."
"if item owners were unclear about the purpose of their presentation in the agenda, it could result in committee members being unprepared for the meeting and create inconsistencies in overall committee record keeping."
"recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure that action items issued by the committees are properly documented and tracked."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation.
"since september 2014, the executive committees group has established processes and tools to support the ability to document and track executive committee business decisions."
departmental vacancy management committee we expected the dvmc to function as stipulated in its tor.
two of the dvmc-s strategic objectives were to -ensure transformation initiatives and projects (from planning to execution) are resourced in an effective and timely manner- and to -ensure that business continuity and service to canadians is maintained-.
"staffing actions were being put on hold, which created operational difficulties that directly affected the organization."
only 65 of 111 (59%) of the reviewed items were found on the dvmc rods.
some of the remaining items were scheduled to appear at committee meetings but were approved secretarially due to meeting cancellations.
a majority of staffing items (106 of 111) were in line with the requirements set out in the tors.
"there were control weaknesses noted as staffing items were accepted and approved without all of the required information, such as the verification of gateway to mobility or the approval of the senior assistant deputy minister."
dvmc-s tors stated that all voting members must be present for quorum to be established.
"during those meetings, 24 staffing items were presented and 20 were approved despite not having met the requirements for quorum."
management response: the chair of the dvmc agrees with the findings of the audit.
"ssc is reviewing its governance as part of its way forward, and will be replacing the current dvmc with an approach that integrates workplace management into its formal governance structure and ensures that staffing activity is planned, approved and regularly monitored."
"these committees noted the need for more information, clarification or granted conditional approvals due to the insufficiency of the information."
the executive committee directives stated that documentation for internal executive committees was required to be submitted 48 hours in advance of the meetings.
interviewees were generally satisfied with the timeliness of information provided.
monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of ssc-s governance structure we expected ssc-s governance structure to be monitored in a regular and timely manner to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness in accordance with the policy and programs and governance and strategic elements of the maf.
"during the audit, ssc-s corporate secretariat was performing two reviews to assess the efficiency of ssc-s governance structure."
"the first was a quarterly review process, which looked at the functioning of the senior committees."
it was expected that the frequency of this review would be reduced to bi-annually.
the second review process was at the adm- and dg-level committees and working groups review.
"through that process, 58 different committees with membership at the dg-level or above had been identified and preliminary inventories of those committees had been taken."
the review was still underway at the completion of the audit work.
"the efficiency of ssc-s committees was also addressed by the executive committee directives, which issued guidance on topics such as length of presentation decks, when materials should be submitted to committees, security measures and avoiding meeting disruptions (e.g. limiting the use of handheld devices)."
the adm- and dg-level review was looking to examine issues related to the effectiveness of the governance structure (e.g. examining the linkages between the committees and mapping out how items move through the governance process).
we were advised that executive committees were monitoring their own effectiveness through the committee chairs.
"conclusion the objective of this audit was to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of ssc-s corporate governance (structure, processes, controls and information for decision making) with a view to supporting efficiency, accountability and achievement of ssc-s mandate."
all executive committees included in this audit had documented and communicated their roles and responsibilities in their respective tors.
"the committees were able to mitigate any concerns by requesting additional information, clarifications, or issuing conditional approvals."
the efficiency of the governance structure was monitored on a regular basis by the corporate secretary-s quarterly review process.
an adm- and dg-level committees and working groups review was also taking place to assess the effectiveness of the governance structure.
these mechanisms were supplemented by committee self-monitoring.
management response and action plans overall management response management has reviewed the summary of findings on the audit of ssc-s governance framework and agrees with the findings of the audit and the recommendations.
ssc agrees that the executive committee tors must be consistently reviewed and approved.
final versions must be available to stakeholders to ensure that they are fulfilling their roles as expected.
ssc also agrees that it is important to monitor and track action items resulting from committee meetings.
"in addition, ssc is reviewing its governance as part of its way forward, and will be replacing the current dvmc with an approach that integrates workplace management into its formal governance structure and ensures that staffing activity is planned, approved and regularly monitored."
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure that committee terms of reference (tor) are approved by the decision-making authority delegating the authority to the committee and that the tors include dates and versioning information."
"management action plan position responsible completion date tors for internal executive committees will be circulated by the executive committees group periodically to committee chairs for review by each committee, to incorporate any required changes."
revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
they will be dated and clearly identified as final versions.
draft versions will also be dated and clearly identified as such.
"changes to the organizational structure, as of april 1, 2015, will also be incorporated into the revised tors for internal executive committees."
the tors review and approval process will be incorporated into the executive committee directives document.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure consistency with the decision-making authorities stated in ssc-s project governance framework (pgof)."
tors will then be circulated by the executive committees group to committee chairs for review by each committee. revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should establish and document decision-making processes for each of the executive committees, including quorum."
management action plan position responsible completion date terms of reference (tor) for internal executive committees will be updated to include the decision-making process as well as the accountability reporting structure. quorum will also be specified.
tors will then be circulated by the executive committees group to committee chairs for review by each committee. revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure that action items issued by the committees are properly documented and tracked."
"management action plan position responsible completion date since september 2014, the executive committees group has established processes and tools to support the ability to document and track executive committee business decisions."
"more specifically, action trackers are used to register action items that have been agreed upon and captured in the record of decisions by respective committees."
"follow-up presentations, along with their respective leads, are then scheduled and tracked through the executive committee integrated forward agenda, which is sent to all management at the assistant deputy minister level on a weekly basis."
"in conjunction with project leads, the executive committees group documents and tracks the movement of action items and their return to committee for presentation until close-out."
management action plan position responsible completion date the dvmc will be replaced with the implementation of human resources plans for each branch that will proactively identify human resources priorities and requirements.
"once approved through formal governance, these plans will serve as the authority to proceed with staffing."
"plans will be regularly monitored by the corporate management board, and a dashboard to monitor performance and workforce growth will be developed for this purpose."
"director general, human resources and workplace september 30, 2015 annex a: audit criteria the following audit criteria were used in the conduct of this audit: ssc established roles, responsibilities and procedures for effective decision making."
ssc-s governance structure was monitored in a regular and timely manner to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.
we found that all executive and dg-level committees included in this audit had documented and communicated their roles and responsibilities in their respective tor.
"we found the approval of tors was inconsistent, both in who approved them and how they were documented."
we also noted that tors were neither dated nor had version tracking.
"as a result, it could be unclear to stakeholders as to whether the up-to-date tors were being consulted which could impact employees who were using them in their work."
the tors for these committees did not contain these responsibilities which may lead to inadequate or inappropriate decision making.
"management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be updated to include the gate approval requirements for each project complexity and risk assessment level, as stated in version 2.0 of ssc-s pgof, dated may 2014."
"however, we found no documented decision-making process for the executive committees."
"although the srb did not have a documented decision-making process, the tors stipulated who must be in attendance for key presentations."
we expected to find that decisions made were at the appropriate committee and within the committee-s mandate.
"we found that all decisions we reviewed were made at the appropriate committee, were within the committees- mandate and were recorded in the meetings- rod. we reviewed a list of items sent directly to the former president of ssc and the chief operating officer for decision to determine if they were following the appropriate approval processes and concluded that they did follow the expected governance structure."
"we found the committees used meeting agendas, corresponding rods and action trackers as their primary tools."
"however, we found several issues regarding attendance, agenda management and action tracking."
we found that meeting attendance varied between committees.
"however, this did not impact the meeting frequency as replacements were sent in most instances."
we found this to not be a significant issue and management has been advised.
"from our sample of agenda items, we found that not all items were recorded in the committee-s action tracker, and only one item was marked as completed during the scope of the audit."
"throughout the scope of the audit, we found that the dvmc did not address its strategic objectives, it had incomplete record keeping and it did not meet as required."
we generated a list of 111 staffing actions based on the dvmc-s staffing action information repository (entitled -dvmc master list-).
"as quorum was not established, these approvals should not have been given."
recommendation 5 the chair of the departmental vacancy management committee should ensure that: meetings take place in accordance with the terms of reference; proposed staffing actions meet all requirements prior to being tabled at a meeting; and decisions are appropriately recorded.
"information provided to the oversight bodies we expected that the information provided to ssc senior level committees would be sufficient, accurate and timely."
"from our review of the rods, we found all but one committee had indicated issues with the sufficiency of information."
"we found no concerns from committee members regarding the accuracy of information presented at the smb, cmc, sppoc, btc and osrc."
there was no documented decision-making process for how decisions were made in the committees.
"however, we found that all decisions reviewed were made at the appropriate committee, were within the committees- mandate and were recorded in the meetings- rod. based on our review, we concluded that there did not appear to be a risk of items circumventing the formal governance structure."
"we found some tools in place to support effective decision making, such as the creation of meeting agendas, corresponding rods and action trackers."
"however, there were issues regarding attendance, agenda management and action tracking."
we found that the dvmc was not functioning as intended.
"there were issues identified with frequent meeting cancelations, the lack of strategic direction setting and record keeping."
"information provided to the senior committees was generally sufficient, accurate and timely."
"management action plan position responsible completion date terms of reference (tor) for internal executive committees will be updated to include the gate approval requirements for each project complexity and risk assessment level, as stated in version 2.0 of the ssc pgof, dated may 2014."
"each action item-s relevant business information, including committee lead and project manager as well as expected completion dates, is documented in the action tracker by the executive committees group and confirmed by each executive committee-s chair."
"director general, cs completed recommendation 5 the chair of the departmental vacancy management committee (dvmc) should ensure that: meetings take place in accordance with the terms of reference; proposed staffing actions meet all requirements prior to being tabled at a meeting; and decisions are appropriately recorded."
"information provided to oversight bodies was sufficient, timely and accurate."
training internal audit expected: all civil aviation inspectors would have access to and have taken the mandatory training required to support their consolidated records of authority.
"internal audit-s assessment: while certain inspectors require mandatory specialty training, some of this training is not currently available as it is under development."
"while there are databases that record the mandatory training of each inspector and their individual credentials, the two databases do not link to each other."
"thus, there is no systematic way to verify easily that an inspector has the mandatory training required to support his or her credentials."
the control that ensures training requirements have been met prior to the issuance of an inspector's credentials relies on validation with the inspector's approving manager.
a more robust control would be to require independent validation against training records.
observations to support internal audit-s assessment: the 2008 oag audit identified the need for civil aviation to develop a training strategy for civil aviation inspectors that aligns with the human resources plan being developed.
"it was expected that the training strategy would need to address the inspectorate-s required competencies, current/recurrent training needs, and courses."
the audit also recommended that transport canada ensure its inspectors meet their training requirements or that their authorities are restricted commensurate with their actual training levels.
a subsequent oag audit in 2012 found that civil aviation had developed a training strategy that did identify the training requirements of the inspectorate.
"as a result of the oag's findings, internal audit focused its attention on ensuring that civil aviation could demonstrate that its inspectorate has the opportunity for timely and relevant training."
"in doing so, civil aviation has created a ""consolidated record of authority"" for each inspector position."
each consolidated record of authority identifies the activities that tc effectively authorizes the inspector to perform.
"in addition, for each inspector position, civil aviation has identified all of the mandatory training requirements for that position."
the safety and security group has recently established a multimodal integrated technical training (mitt) branch.
this branch is responsible for maintaining a record of all training completed by each inspector.
"the branch also provides training courses, including mandatory training."
"the regulatory affairs division, of civil aviation-s policy and regulatory services (prs) branch, reviews and confirms with the inspector's manager that the inspector has completed all required training for the credentials they are applying for (e.g. badge, pass, letter, etc)."
we attempted to reconcile that all inspectors had the mandatory training required for their issued credentials.
training records and inspector credentials are maintained in two different databases.
ideally civil aviation should be able to confirm that inspectors meet the training requirements for their credentials on a real time basis.
"civil aviation has defined two key categories of mandatory training for the inspectorate, foundational and specialized."
foundational training is training to acquire common knowledge and competencies for job performance.
(e.g. delegated officer initial training).
certain positions require specialized training.
some of this specialized training includes an initial course as well as recurrent training after a specified period.
"while foundational training is being provided, 11 out of 19 mandatory specialized training courses and 2 out of 6 mandatory recurrent training courses, to ensure the competency of inspectors to carry out their functions, are in development."
"of the 13 mandatory training courses in development, one is being offered by a third- party provider in the interim."
"finally, we noted that the recommendations and management action plans concerning training focused on the surveillance activities of inspectors."
"an inspector has many other work requirements for which there are currently little or no training courses available (e.g., reviewing manuals)."
areas requiring further attention: civil aviation should ensure that all mandatory training courses are developed and/or available to the inspectorate to meet the mandatory training requirements.
civil aviation should ensure it has the ability to verify in a timely manner that inspectors have met the mandatory training requirements for their consolidated records of authority.
"civil aviation should define the actions to be taken when mandatory recurrent training is not completed on time (e.g., restricting an inspector-s consolidated record of authority)."
"civil aviation should define, develop, and provide training requirements for nonsurveillance work."
civil aviation would establish a standard for the minimum planned surveillance level for sms and non-sms enterprises to monitor for compliance with the regulatory framework.
civil aviation would also report on performance against the surveillance plans to senior management on a regular basis. internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation-s sms transition plan has been placed on hold.
civil aviation has established a standard for the minimum planned surveillance level for sms and non-sms enterprises to monitor for compliance with the regulatory framework.
performance against surveillance plans is reported to senior management on a regular basis.
"therefore, there are no detailed transition plans other than what was published on transport canada-s website in 2004."
civil aviation published an advisory circular 503-003 in 2008 which identifies the components and elements that an organization should have in place at the end of each phase.
aviation enterprises are subject to planned surveillance over a five-year period.
the planned surveillance intervals are consistently determined for each enterprise using the -surveillance planning- module in nasims (national safety information management system).
the surveillance policy (cad sur-008) and national surveillance planning standard (si sur-009) provide guidance.
safety issues internal audit expected: civil aviation had analyzed and revised processes for addressing safety issues in order to address issues more quickly.
internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has reviewed its rulemaking consultation process and has identified and implemented new ways of addressing safety issues.
a new model and new tools were developed that provide improved responsiveness and increased efficiency and effectiveness.
"observations to support internal audit-s assessment: the carac (canadian aviation regulation advisory council) modernization project was launched in 2011 with the objective of creating a consultation model that better addresses safety issues, streamlines processes, and prioritizes regulatory initiatives in the early stages."
"the project engaged stakeholders and reviewed best practices from other regulatory departments and counterparts in other jurisdictions (i.e. civil aviation safety authority (australia), federal aviation administration (usa), european aviation safety agency (europe))."
the new model and tools received support from the carac plenary in october 2013 and were implemented by december 2013.
"while a new process has been implemented, it is too soon to determine if it is actually shortening the time to respond."
civil aviation has seen time efficiencies from the new process in a few cases.
"for example, in the case of one regulatory initiative (aerodrome work consultations), it took 19 months from the time carac members were engaged to the publishing of the proposed regulations."
"the analysis will be conducted by subject matter experts from civil aviation headquarters, regions and industry and will inform planning and priority-setting processes, policy development, and rule making."
civil aviation has identified an initial list of priority system-level safety issues which helped inform the 2016/17 business planning process.
the top four safety issues were prioritized by senior executives (ncamx) and will be considered in developing work plans for the next fiscal year.
civil aviation has identified resource requirements to carry out the surveillance activities.
civil aviation is monitoring deviations from the surveillance plans.
a process has also been implemented to identify resource requirements to carry out surveillance activities.
civil aviation has implemented a process that ensures deviations from the approved inspection plans are reviewed and approved by senior management.
"monthly regional surveillance data is rolled up into quarterly national oversight plans that are reviewed and approved by the operational management committee, national civil aviation management executive (ncamx) and so3mb."
deviations from the regional surveillance plans are reviewed by ncamx and require approval from so3mb.
the information required for nasims is collected and inputted by inspectors.
there is a process in place to ensure the quality of information being inputted into nasims.
we would suggest that civil aviation ensure the information inputted into nasims is both accurate and complete.
there is confusion on the part of the inspectorate on the operations and the intent of nasims.
"in particular, inspectors do not always appreciate how certain companies can be elevated or lowered within nasims to have more frequent or less frequent inspections."
civil aviation should consider reviewing how it explains the functionality and purpose of nasims to the inspectorate.
civil aviation should ensure the applicability of nasims and specifically the factors inspectors assess.
there would also be documented managerial oversight of inspector surveillance activities. there would be a quality assurance program of the inspectors- surveillance activities.
"staff instructions include the requirement for management review and approval of the planning, conducting and reporting of surveillance activities."
"in addition, there is documented managerial oversight of inspector surveillance activities. there is a quality assurance program that includes inspectors' surveillance activities."
"observations to support internal audit-s assessment: quality control management is reviewing and approving surveillance activities as evidenced in quality assessments, file reviews and group/committee minutes."
the surveillance procedures also now provide many templates to document the surveillance activities.
on-site regional workshops were held in 2013 in order to inform inspectors and managers of the updated surveillance procedures.
the internal audit team reviewed 61 regional inspection/assessment files using similar criteria as the 2012 oag audit and the subsequent 2012 civil aviation self assessment and found that improvements have been made in the consistency and the compliance to established procedures as well as management review.
the internal audit file review found 98% of files had a sampling plan compared to 46% in civil aviation-s file review and the oag-s finding that sampling plans were rarely prepared.
the internal audit file review also found evidence of management review in 66% of files compared to 56% in civil aviation-s file review and the oag-s finding of no formal management review and approval process.
the internal audit team also reviewed the surveillance procedures that guide inspectors when developing and implementing sampling plans.
"specifically we reviewed the terminology, documentation requirements, methods used to determine sample size and samples, and the related templates."
"as well, a few inspectors were interviewed to better understand how they apply the procedures."
the civil aviation quality control of surveillance activities directive (cad) qua-017 outlines the guiding principles and establishes the minimum standards for quality control (qc) of surveillance activities.
the aim is to ensure a documented and nationally consistent approach when conducting qc of the inspection of regulated enterprises in accordance with the process detailed in si-sur 001.
"as of september 1, 2015, civil aviation is conducting 100% qc of surveillance activity files in all regions following the model used in quebec region."
all files will be assessed until an 85% conformance rating is achieved.
"once the 85% threshold is achieved and sustained, civil aviation, through its operations management committee (omc), will establish a national standard for qc to be conducted on a random sample of activity."
note that the quebec region implemented 100% qc assessments of all surveillance activity files in 2013.
quality assurance civil aviation developed and implemented the civil aviation internal quality assurance program (caiqap) within the management and resource services branch.
the caiqap plan was approved by ncamx in 2012. .
"of the 18 qa assessments planned in the five year caiqap plan, four were completed, two are in progress, one is planned for this fiscal year, six will be recommended to management for next fiscal year, and five were deferred."
two additional assessments were conducted outside of the caiqap scope.
staff instructions have been developed to provide guidance and templates for conducting qa assessments and developing and implementing corrective action plans.
the caiqap plan is subject to ongoing monitoring/tracking on a regular basis.
management and resource services reports the qa assessment reports as well as the overall status of the plan to ncamx (three to four times per year).
"the plan-s status is also reported to senior management (adm, safety & security, so3mb) when requested (twice per year)."
management and resource services reviews and updates the plan on an annual basis.
areas requiring further attention: the guidance related to sampling needs to be clarified and inspectors provided with adequate training.
"performance measurement internal audit expected: civil aviation to have developed key performance indicators that will assess the extent to which its programs and initiatives, including implementation of sms, are contributing to achieving the department-s long-term objectives."
observations to support internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has developed a set of performance indicators that provide yearly targets for a three-year period.
these performance indicators are reported annually in the departmental performance report.
tc-s evaluation function reviewed civil aviation-s performance indicators and provided a preliminary assessment of these indicators.
"they noted the performance measurement framework relies more heavily on quantitative than qualitative methodologies, which is not unusual."
civil aviation proposes client satisfaction indicators which would allow for the use of qualitative methods.
some elaboration would be beneficial to demonstrate the use of qualitative methods with regards to these indicators.
adding a measure of the extent to which the regulatory framework is harmonized with international legislation would provide further opportunity for the use of qualitative methods.
"in addition, tc-s evaluation function has embarked on a new performance measurement initiative with a view to strengthening performance measurement in the department."
"as part of this initiative the evaluation function will work with the civil aviation directorate (as well as other modes in the safety and security group) to improve the relevance, quality, and comparability of performance data."
tc-s evaluation function will be working with civil aviation to this end.
human resources (notip) internal audit expected: the national organization transition implementation project (notip) would be completed.
internal audit-s assessment: notip is now complete.
the development and implementation of a change management plan is no longer relevant as this project has now been completed.
"this document also transferred assets, deliverables, residual issues, and all ongoing administrative functions to the management services branch of civil aviation."
"human resources (staffing) internal audit expected: civil aviation to have a national human resources plan that identifies the number of inspectors required to carry out its work, their competencies, and a recruitment strategy to fill any vacancies."
"civil aviation to complete the staffing of middle management and supervisory positions currently filled on an acting basis. internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has a human resources plan that identifies the number of inspectors required to carry out its work, their competencies, and a recruitment strategy to fill any vacancies."
"in addition, civil aviation has filled the majority of middle management and supervisory positions on an indeterminate basis."
this document is closed since civil aviation met its staffing target levels; ongoing activities continue such as national collective staffing inventories.
all middle management and supervisory positions which were occupied on a long-term acting basis have been staffed with the exception of five positions waiting to be classified as a result of notip.
"once those positions have been classified, they can be permanently staffed."
database systems internal audit expected: the business intelligence infrastructure (bii) project would be on track for completion march 2016.
internal audit-s assessment: the bii project is not on track.
observations to support internal audit-s assessment: an extra year will be required to finalize bii.
civil aviation and the technology and information services directorate have prepared an investment justification form in order to access capital funds next year.
the bii project is listed as the top business priority for civil aviation.
"phase iii, the final phase of the bii project, is scheduled to be completed by march 2017."
"finally, civil aviation has not defined the actions to be taken when mandatory recurrent training is not completed on time (e.g., restricting an inspector-s consolidated record of authority)."
"however the audit repeated the earlier recommendation that the inspectorate ""receive the training necessary to execute their responsibilities in a timely manner."""
"simply put, civil aviation identifies all the activities that a given inspector may conduct; which is based on the various regulations that civil aviation oversees."
"however, based on our review, it would appear that a more effective control would be to have mitt validate that the inspector has completed the required training courses versus solely relying on the manager."
these two systems are not aligned and currently the only way to confirm that an inspector has the necessary training to support their credentials is to manually trace and reconcile the records in the two systems.
"while civil aviation deems recurrent training as mandatory, it has not defined the impact on an inspector-s consolidated record of authority when his or her mandatory recurrent training is not completed on time."
"however, we found that surveillance activities represent only part of an inspector's responsibilities."
"in future, civil aviation should ensure that inspector credentials are not issued until training records are validated with the mitt group who are the holders of the official training records."
specific risk related enterprise information is entered in each enterprise-s risk profile page to determine the risk indicator level and the impact value that ultimately determine the surveillance interval.
data however was unavailable to confirm that issues are actually being addressed more quickly.
"the new tools include: preliminary issue & consultation assessment (pica) (input to carac): assists in the early evaluation of an issue, determines the need for a focus group and recommends an appropriate consultation stream; revised notice of proposed amendment (npa) (output from carac): communicates regulatory change proposals to regulations and standards to the aviation community and provides summaries of the assessments, evaluations and recommendations leading to the proposal; and enhanced carac activity reporting system: now provides information on all carac activities and is a communication tool with stakeholders for relevant information throughout the rulemaking process (more transparent and meaningful consultation)."
this year civil aviation is undertaking an initiative to establish an annual strategic safety risk analysis (ssra) process to evaluate and monitor system-level safety issues in canada-s civil aviation system.
internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has implemented the national aviation safety information management system (nasims) which contains the risk level and minimum surveillance requirements for each enterprise.
observations to support internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has implemented the nasims which is a database for gathering information required for developing a risk profile for each enterprise.
the risk profile is the combination of the: risk indicator level: likelihood that the enterprise is managing risks to an acceptable level of safety and compliance: and impact value: determination of the impact of the enterprise on the aviation transportation system and public confidence.
nasims uses the risk indicator level and the impact value to calculate the surveillance interval for planning purposes.
"based on this information, regional surveillance plans are developed and progress is reported on a monthly basis to the respective regional directors, operational management committee and national oversight office."
"internal audit is starting an audit of risk-based business planning for activities in safety and security that will look in depth at how oversight activities are planned, tracked and reported, including examining the information used to support those plans and reports."
the audit will also be looking at the appropriateness of different levels of oversight activities based on whether the enterprise is an sms or nonsms enterprise.
areas requiring further attention: nasims is the foundation of the risk assessment process of enterprises.
internal audit found however that this process is not being followed.
"finally, there were concerns expressed that the risk indicator questions in nasims do not apply to all the sectors of aviation especially the unique issues of small operators."
"quality control, quality assurance internal audit expected: there would be appropriate guidance on inspector surveillance activities, including the level of documentation required to support this activity."
internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has developed and implemented staff instructions on inspector surveillance activities. there is however a need for clearer guidance on sampling methods and the related training for inspectors.
roles and responsibilities for appropriate management review and approval for planning surveillance activities are documented in the surveillance policy (cad sur-008 2012-05-29) and in the national surveillance planning standard (si sur-009 (2012-05-31).
"based on the oag's audit and a self assessment by civil aviation, the surveillance procedures (si sur-001) were updated to include increased management review, approval and sign off requirements for the surveillance manager and convening authority throughout the surveillance process (pre-site, on-site, post-site), and a new layer of management review through the surveillance review committee."
the proposed qa assessments were prioritized based on audit recommendations and current departmental priorities.
"internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has developed annual key performance indicators, although there were no indicators related to sms."
"areas requiring further attention: while civil aviation has developed performance indicators as identified in their map, these performance indicators could be strengthened."
"observations to support internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has confirmed, through their notip closure report dated march 2014, that this project is now complete."
this report assessed the project-s performance and lessons learned and confirmed that the essential contractual and other project closure activities have been completed.
"observations to support internal audit-s assessment: civil aviation has developed a national human resource plan that is currently embodied in three documents namely the aviation safety 2015-2016: environmental scanning, swot, risk analysis document, the hr planning and the aviation safety people management action plan, and the integrated planning report."
"in addition, civil aviation has identified four -public service key leadership competencies- and four specific civil aviation competencies as follows: leadership competencies values & ethics, strategic thinking, engagement, and management excellence civil aviation specific competencies communications partnering risk management safety management systems civil aviation-s recruitment strategies were contained in the document national civil aviation program recruitment strategies for oversight positions - core occupational groups (ao, ti, en and ai)."
"however, final approval is required to secure resources to complete the project."
"fraud governance and management framework deloitte has determined that eccc has effectively designed and implemented many policies and procedures which are, for the most part aligned with the coso framework leading practices."
"for example, the existence of eccc values and ethics code of conduct, the existence of an administrative investigation policy as well as eccc internal control framework and monitoring strategy for internal control management."
the following presents the aeb-s summary of deloitte-s findings.
the review noted that information regarding fraud cases is not being shared and communicated to all relevant stakeholders in a systematic manner.
"while some components of a corporate fraud policy are covered through various means (policy on the conduct of administrative investigation, the internal control framework, values and ethics code of conduct, learner-s roadmaps, and the monitoring strategy for internal control management), some gaps remain."
a more integrated fraud policy/strategy would help ensure that fraud is addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner.
"the fraud policy should also include a definition of fraud, responsibility structure for managing fraud, organizational attitude to fraud, policy on disciplinary action and identification of a central function and individual as a responsible party for the anti-fraud programs and controls program."
"recommendation 1 with the support of the deputy minister and in consultation with the executive management committee members, corporate services branch should coordinate the review of the governance and policy framework over the management of fraud, in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities and to enhance the existing policies to address the observations raised by deloitte."
management response agree.
corporate services branch will review the mandate and terms of reference of the departmental security committee and eccc policy on the conduct of administrative investigations.
"this was achieved through a documentation review, a series of interviews and brainstorm workshops."
"in total, 58 unique fraud scenarios were developed through this process."
this table also shows the comparison to other public sector organizations results.
the information contained in the detailed report was provided to responsible branch heads under separate cover.
"recommendation 2 the assistant deputy minister from finance branch, corporate services branch, human resources branch, enforcement branch and environmental stewardship branch should review the detailed observations and suggestions presented in deloitte-s report and ascertain whether the suggested actions for improvement should be implemented."
"management response finance branch, corporate services branch, human resources branch, enforcement branch and environmental stewardship branch accepts the recommendation to analyze the detailed observations outlined in deloitte-s report to determine the extent to which suggested actions can be implemented."
"however, gaps still exist in some areas."
"also, the current administrative investigation policy does not explicitly identify finance branch (fb) as a supporting office related to fraud."
"in many instances, fb can identify relevant information as it pertains to fraud investigation, in addition to playing a key role in the design of appropriate controls to mitigate the fraud risks."
not involving all relevant stakeholders in the process increases the risk that control activities that may have failed may not be effectively addressed and/or reviewed by the appropriate business line.
policy eccc does not have a formal departmental fraud policy.
"in reviewing eccc-s policy on the conduct of administrative investigation, deloitte noted that the current policy could be improved in the following areas: use of outside counsel of specialist when required; formal guidance regarding the potential for conflict of interest during the investigative process; vacation monitoring; fraud training for new hires and periodic training for all employees; ethical behaviour expectation of vendors; tracking/logging of fraud cases; periodic update of the fra; and tracking the performance of antifraud efforts."
the goal of a corporate fraud policy is to safeguard the reputation and financial viability of an entity through improved management of fraud risk.
fraud risk assessment deloitte has identified and validated potential fraud risk scenarios relevant to the business components identified in the scope section of this report.
"the scenarios were mapped to eccc-s internal controls to assess whether the controls would either prevent or detect the scenario, and determine the overall residual risk for each scenario."
"of these unique fraud scenarios, 19 were assessed as having medium or high residual risk."
the table below depicts the results for the 58 identified risk ranked scenarios by business components.
"while eccc-s business components show a slightly higher percentage of residual risk, deloitte has indicated that eccc is well within the acceptable range."
risk scenarios by business components deloitte presented under a separate report the results of the fra along with the suggested remedial actions or improvements to existing controls for high and medium residual risk scenarios.
"overall, the privacy management practices of participating departments were similar to those of other departments."
all departments have developed a privacy policy framework (ppf) as required by the privacy act and the tb policy on privacy protection.
"while most departments responded that the implementation was well advanced, to date only one has fully implemented its ppf."
oversight is provided through general governance structures and the reporting relationships for all departments.
all departments have taken steps to limit the collection of personal information.
"all departments offer employee training on privacy issues, and most periodically remind employees of their obligations."
"privacy policy framework as per the tb policy on privacy protection, heads of government institutions are responsible for the effective, well-coordinated, and proactive management of the privacy act and privacy regulations within their institutions."
documented directives and protocol help heads coordinate and be proactive in managing an effective privacy program.
an ppf should set out clear responsibilities in government institutions for decision-making and managing the implementation of the privacy act and privacy regulations.
six had 50% or more of their frameworks implemented.
one department was planning its implementation for march 2015. frameworks for the majority of departments included similar sections.
"most departments followed tbs guidance and include guidance on privacy practices, privacy impact assessments (pias), privacy breaches, and consent and notification/release."
"all departments have guidelines on privacy breaches, which were covered by the latest tb guidelines for privacy breaches."
"these guidelines are in addition to and complement general tb policies and guidelines, such as the 2008 tb directive on social insurance number (sin)."
one department-s ppf demonstrates best practices and includes several guideline documents.
"the roles, responsibilities and requirements are described in detail."
"for example, the departmental policy governing the management of personal information sets out the differences between delegated authority and legislated responsibilities."
the same document describes the retention and destruction requirements as well as a privacy protocol for non-administrative purposes.
"as a best practice, an effective ppf would require regular gap analysis to make sure relevant policies have been properly implemented."
"of the six departments that have implemented a policy framework, three have conducted a gap analysis of their compliance with tb policy and directives."
one department responded that it has developed a privacy breach guideline as a result of its gap analysis.
the following table presents the department-s key guideline topics included in their ppf.
the departments responded with a yes or no answer according to the key guideline topics in their respective ppf.
"once an order is signed, the powers, duties or functions that have been delegated may only be exercised or performed by the head of the institution or by the named officer(s) or employee(s)."
delegates are accountable for any decisions they make.
"heads of government institutions are responsible for deciding whether to delegate, pursuant to section 73 of the privacy act, any of their powers, duties or functions under the act."
all seven departments follow best practices and have a formal delegation of authority in place.
"the level of delegation of authority differs from department to department, (see figure 2) but all involve their atip group."
figure 2: delegation for privacy management authority levels assistant deputy minister / chief privacy officer yes yes yes no yes yes no director general responsible for atip no yes yes no yes yes yes director of atip yes yes yes yes yes no yes deputy director / manager of atip no yes yes yes yes no no figure 2 description the above mentioned table describes the different responsibility levels of delegation in all seven of the participating departments for privacy management.
"the departments responded with a yes or no answer for the following authority levels: assistant deputy minister/chief privacy officer, two out of seven departments answered no; director general responsible for atip, two out of seven departments answered no; director of atip, one out of seven departments answered no; and deputy director/manager of atip, four out of seven departments answered yes."
"according to tbs management accountability framework (maf) guidance, departments should have in place an oversight body for the governance of its management, which would include the management of its privacy responsibilities."
"when questioned on this guidance, no department specifically mentioned having an oversight body."
departments responded by referring to their formal delegation of authorities and reporting relationships.
oversight is provided through general governance structures and the reporting relationships.
"to ensure an effective ppf has been implemented and that proper oversight has been provided on privacy practices, the tb policy on privacy protection makes heads of government institutions or their delegates responsible for monitoring compliance with the policy as it relates to the administration of the privacy act."
this monitoring can take the form of a privacy review or audit.
"one department conducted a privacy audit in 2010 and another department conducted a privacy assessment in 2013. roles and responsibilities as per the tb policy on privacy protection, heads of government institutions should ensure clear responsibilities for decision-making and managing the application of the privacy act and privacy regulations."
"they should also ensure employees of the government institution are made aware of policies, procedures and legal responsibilities under the act."
"we noted the best practice of providing written documentation on the roles and responsibilities through a framework or a handbook, and providing training sessions to employees."
"disclosure and collection of personal information this section covers the collection, processing and disclosure of personal information specific to the procurement and staffing processes."
"collection according to the privacy act, personal information shall not be collected by a government institution unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution."
the following (figure 3) presents the results of the survey specific to procurement and contracting activities.
the table also displays considerable variety in terms of other types of personal information that is collected.
figure 3 - personal information collected for procurement activities information collected of departments collecting this information name x x x x x x x address (past and present) x x x x x x x email address x x x x x x x phone number x x x x x x billing rate or exact salary figure x x x x x x date of birth x x x x x confirmation of security clearance x x x x x previous employment x x x x work start and end dates x x x x x location of work x x x x academic level x x x social insurance number x x x hours of work (temp help) x x x other x x x figure 3 description the above mentioned table displays the results of personal information collected for procurement activities in all seven departments.
"the departments responded to a specific survey and the results are as follows: name, address (past and present) and email address 100%; phone number and billing rate or exact salary figure 86%; date of birth and confirmation of security clearance 71%; previous work employment, work start and end dates and location of work 57%; and academic level, social insurance number and hours of work (temp help) and other 43%."
"in the case of the staffing process, we noted that, as a best practice, , rather than collecting copies of personal identification related to staffing actions, one department requires the hiring managers to sign a letter attesting to the fact that they have viewed the identification."
this provides an additional safeguard against any unauthorized access to personal information.
the following presents the type of personal information collected in the context of the staffing process.
"once again, the table shows that there is a wide variety of information that is collected, with the following information being collected by all departments: name, address, phone number, email address and r-sum-s."
"under the category of -other types of information,- one department noted that they collect a signed consent form allowing the release of the individual-s personal information into the priority information management system (pims)."
"figure 4 - personal information collected for staffing activities staffing of departments collecting this information name x x x x x x address (past and present) x x x x x x phone number x x x x x x email address x x x x x x r-sum- x x x x x x academic level x x x x x confirmation of security clearance x x x x x social insurance number x x x x x psychological assessment x x x x x work start and end date x x x x x date of birth x x x x attestation from academic institutions x x x x personal security briefing form x x x x personal record identifier (pri) x x x x scan of citizenship card x x x x proof of canadian citizenship attestation x x x x hours of work x x x x location of work x x x x supervisor-s name and position x x x x previous employment x x x x scan of driver-s license x x x scan of birth certificate x x x scan of passport x x x exact salary figure x x x position classification code x x x other, please specify x x x figure 4 description the above mentioned table displays the results of personal information collected for staffing activities from six of the seven departments."
"the results are as follows: name, address (past and present), phone number, email address and resume 100%; academic level, confirmation of security clearance, social insurance number, psychological assessment and work start and end dates 83%; date of birth, attestation from academic institutions, personal security briefing form, personal record identifier (pri), scan of citizenship card, proof of canadian citizenship attestation, hours of work, location of work, supervisor-s name and position and previous employment 67% and; scan of driver-s license, scan of birth certificate, scan of passport, exact salary figure, position classification code and other 50%."
"the privacy act requires that when personal information is collected, the individual be informed of the purpose for which the information is collected."
best practice would require some form of documentation as to how an individual was informed of the purpose of collection.
most departments informed the individual that their personal information would be protected through a privacy protection clause included in the forms/contracts that collect personal information.
one department informed individuals either by phone or by email.
the act and the tb policy on privacy protection do not describe the methods of collection that can be used.
"depending on the type of information collected and its sensitivity, the departments surveyed use a variety of collection methods."
"for contracting, of the seven departments that participated in the study: six collect personal information via email and forms; five obtain information by telephone or fax; four obtain personal information through scanned copy; and three obtain information either by paper or by other means such as quotes submitted by the vendor."
"for staffing, the six departments responding to the survey questions collect personal information for staffing actions through one or more of the following methods: six use email; one uses either fax or telephone; six use either paper or electronic forms ."
"processing once the personal information has been collected, departments require robust processes to ensure that their personal information collections are secure and are accurate for reporting on an annual basis."
"the use of printers or scanners requires a protocol for ensuring the information is not left stored on the device, and printed material must be shared and stored in accordance with classification requirements."
"for contracting, of the seven departments responding to the survey questions: all seven process personal information through email; six use system software or an application for their personal information collections; and two also process the information through the use of fax, paper, printer or scanner."
"(see figure 5) for staffing, of the six departments responding to the survey questions: all six process personal information through email and a system software or application (e.g. peoplesoft); and three also include paper forms and files in their processes."
"(see figure 5) as stated in the previous section, email and electronic forms are seen as better practices to process personal information because of the encryption capability."
figure 5 - methods for processing personal information for staffing and procurement activities figure 5 description the above mentioned bar chart depicts the survey results on methods used for processing personal information for staffing and contracting activities.
all seven departments responded to questions on contracting and only six departments on staffing.
"disclosure to comply with the intent of the act and tb policy, departments should restrict access to personal information to those employees who need this information to operate their program and to others according to the allowable purposes for disclosure to a public or private institution, pursuant to section 13 of the act."
"when surveyed, all departments responded that they only give formal access to personal information to those employees within the department who have responsibilities for either staffing or procurement, such as administrative officers or team leaders responsible for administering a contract, hr employees and managers responsible for staffing actions."
sharing information depends on each department-s mandate.
"some departments work closely together, which necessitates the sharing of personal information."
"according to the survey, all departments comply with the purposes set out in section 13 of the act."
"one of the expected results of the tb policy on privacy protection is to ensure consistent public reporting on the administration of the act through annual reports to parliament, statistical reports and the annual publication of info source."
"all seven departments stated that they produce a statistical report and description of their pib. with the exception of one department, all also review their description on an annual basis."
privacy impact assessments the tb policy on government security and the tb directive on privacy impact assessments require that pias be conducted for substantially modified programs and activities that involve personal information.
six departments follow the best practice of documenting their pia processes.
"results also show that other departments are using a variety of methods to partially fulfill this responsibility: in one department, the atip group works closely with their it group and therefore gets notified when there are any information systems that are being implemented or substantially modified; another department shares a pia questionnaire with all program managers."
"employee awareness and training according to treasury board policies and directives, all employees who handle personal information or are involved in the design and implementation of systems that handle personal information must be made fully aware of their obligations."
all departments conduct training and awareness sessions.
some departments make it mandatory for all new employees and provide the training as part of their orientation.
the following lists the types of best practices for providing training to employees within the different departments: part of the intensive program for new inspectors (prep-school).
by request and tailor-made (divisional).
awareness sessions at management/governance tables.
in conjunction with im awareness training.
monthly meetings with atip liaison officers to answer any questions.
"tutorial provided with the statement, and posting on the internal web page."
four departments followed best practice and sent reminders to employees regarding privacy breaches.
"a privacy breach is an incident or event that violates the privacy act and occurs when there is improper or unauthorized collection, use, disclosure, retention or disposal of personal information."
one department was unaware as to whether such a device was being used in their department at the time of this survey.
four departments use laptops and usb or portable drives to collect personal information.
"of those departments, three have proper protection procedures in place requiring that the usb key be ordered through the it groups and encrypted."
"although there are similarities in the departments- tools for processing personal information, there is considerable variety in terms of the type of personal information they collect."
"although all seven departments have developed a ppf, only one has fully implemented its framework."
figure 1 - key guideline topics in ppf privacy practices/protocol/roles and responsibilities yes yes yes no yes yes yes privacy impact assessments / risk assessments yes yes yes no yes yes yes privacy breaches yes yes yes yes yes yes yes social insurance number (sin) no no yes no no no no consent and notification / release guidelines no no no yes yes yes yes figure 1 description the above mentioned table describes the department-s key guideline topics included the participating departments- privacy policy framework (ppf).
"the topics included: privacy practices/protocol/roles and responsibilities, one out of seven departments answered no; privacy impact assessments/risk assessments, one out of seven departments answered no; privacy breaches, all departments answered yes; social insurance number (sin), one out of seven departments answered yes; and consent and notification/release guidelines, four out of seven departments answered yes."
"governance and oversight as per the tb policy on privacy protection, heads of government institutions are responsible for: deciding whether to delegate any of their powers, duties or functions under the act; and signing an order, if a decision is made to delegate, authorizing one or more officers or employees of the institution, who are at the appropriate level, to exercise or perform the powers, duties or functions of the head, specified in the order."
"ultimate responsibility, however, still rests with the head of the government institution."
"although six departments communicate employee roles and responsibilities through their atip groups, one department could not confirm whether these had been communicated."
"while the purpose of this exercise was not to assess whether information collected was related to an operating program, the aeb was interested in understanding the type of information being collected in the context of procurement and staffing processes and possibly enable implementation of best practices where possible."
it is important to note that one department (department 6) did not provide a response to this section of the survey.
"it also states that: -personal information under the control of a government institution should not, without the consent of the individual to whom it relates, be disclosed by the institution except in accordance with this section.- the tb policy on privacy protection specifically states that departments should ensure that appropriate privacy protection clauses are included in contracts and agreements that may involve intergovernmental or trans-border flows of personal information."
"based on our analysis of the information received, email and electronic forms are seen as better practices to collect personal information because of the encryption capability."
"although one department has formalized its process, they are still conducting pias on an ad hoc basis."
"information holdings the tb policy on privacy protection requires that departments -ensure effective protection and management of personal information by identifying, assessing, monitoring and mitigating privacy risks in government programs and activities involving the collection, retention, use, disclosure and disposal of personal information.- the results of our analysis indicated that six departments use encryption digital signatures and certificate authentication to mitigate the risk of a privacy breach."
"the controls in place over cesi reporting were operating effectively, ensuring that the cesi met the quality attributes."
this allowed for variability in the quality of performance data and information presented in the dpr.
"overall governance for external reporting governance would be expected to include at least: documented clear roles and responsibilities at corporate and branch levels; clear processes for planning, coordinating and reporting (including quality assurance); clear lines of authority for approvals."
the audit examined the governance exercised over the external reporting on performance for the dpr and the cesi.
"consistent with previous office of the auditor general of canada-s reports and the tb policy on management, resources and results structures (mrrs), it was expected that eccc would have proper governance in place that ensures: coordination and control of the various performance measurement frameworks in the department; integration of relevant data and information; and a formal system of lessons learned and follow-up."
"coordination and control of the various performance measurement frameworks in the department senior management roles, responsibilities and approval processes were in place for both dpr and cesi reporting."
the deputy minister has delegated to the finance branch responsibility for updating the performance measurement framework (pmf) and managing the cycle for the rpp and dpr according to treasury board secretariat (tbs) guidelines.
the strategic policy branch (spb) has the responsibility for cesi reporting.
the deputy minister (dm) and assistant deputy ministers (adms) sign final approval on all dpr and cesi reporting.
good informal cooperation among the branches existed to reduce duplication of effort.
"for example, many of the cesi supported by the science and technology branch (stb) had been used in the preparation of the dpr reporting."
"for rpp and dpr reporting, senior management roles and responsibilities have been assigned, there was a functioning system of approvals, and senior management provided overall supervision of the maintenance of the pmf and rpp/dpr reporting."
the governance over cesi reporting was functioning in a proper manner.
a description of some of the related governance processes can be found in more detail in section 2.2 on cesi.
"integration of relevant data and information to integrate relevant data and information into the dpr, the finance branch, through its corporate management directorate (cmd), communicates to the various branches the tbs requirements and formats for updating the program alignment architecture (paa) and pmf and preparing the rpp and dpr."
"the branches retain the responsibility for the preparation and quality of rpp and dpr content, including performance reporting against expected results."
each branch has established its own measures and routines for developing and reviewing the content of the dpr.
"over the past few years, the cmd has provided considerable informal assistance to the branches for their paa, pmf and dpr submissions."
"for example, the cmd has helped the branches with the development of their outcomes definitions (expected results), the development of their performance indicators and targets, and the wording for inclusion in the dpr."
this led to variability in the quality of performance data and information in the dpr.
"until recently, lessons learned for dpr reporting at cmd and in the branches were not formally recorded and followed-up."
"during the audit, the finance branch, led by the cmd, initiated a formal discussion of lessons learned with selected planners from across the department, who are also members of the planning collaboration network (pcn)."
the cmd initiated the use of information sharing / coordination software (sharepoint) to record cmd actions for updating the 2014-2015 pmf and to document pcn activities.
"by the end of the audit, the pcn had met twice to discuss lessons learned."
"the members contributed many ideas for improving dpr external reporting, such as the break-down of the overall process into smaller manageable stages to help provide clarity and improve the timeliness of branch submissions."
"other suggestions included making better use of the sharepoint webpages, improving cmd and network written and verbal guidance, and ways to improve both overall timeliness and the approval processes."
the cmd documented the meetings on sharepoint.
"these events occurred near the end of the audit, and we observed no subsequent activities or follow-up on the recorded lessons learned."
controls over the quality of canadian environmental sustainability indicators eccc reports its canadian environmental sustainability indicators (cesi) online.
"while these indicators are scientific in nature, they are also used to measure progress in terms of the goals and targets of the federal sustainable development strategy (fsds), report to canadians on the state of the environment and describe canada-s progress on key environmental sustainability issues."
"on a daily basis, canadians access cesi information for personal, academic and economic reasons-on average close to 300 times per day. over the past two years, eccc has increased the number of indicators reported to over 50."
these indicators are important to eccc-s profile in the community and its scientific reputation.
"the indicators, supported by scientific methodology, are updated as new data become available."
"the internet posting of an indicator contains links to a -data sources and methods- webpage which describes how the data is collected and its limitations, and to a webpage that describes the indicator in detail."
it may also contain links to related topics.
"eccc-s strategic policy branch (spb) leads the process and its quality manual for cesi sets out steps to be followed, provides templates and describes the required documentation procedures."
"in consultation with branches or other government departments, the spb develops new indicators and updates existing ones on a cyclical basis."
"during the development or cyclical update of an indicator, the spb prepares a brief summary sheet for discussion with its partners in the internal review."
"the summary sheet contains a policy relevance rating, a utility rating, a methodology soundness rating and a data availability rating."
"each indicator being developed or updated must go through a rigorous technical review by either the eccc program or other government departments, and the spb."
"for the purpose of documenting this review, each comment or suggestion received is put into a disposition table which accumulates all the interventions and their disposition."
"once there is consensus that the science is sound and the proper review has been carried out, approval processes are followed which lead to senior management and deputy minister (dm) approval before reporting."
the spb uses information sharing / coordination software (sharepoint) to record and store all the documentation of work done.
"the files are organized by indicator, allowing retrieval for future updates and lessons learned."
"the audit examined the controls over the quality of cesi to verify whether they ensured that the reported indicators met the quality attributes of robustness, accuracy, reliability and timeliness according to the audit criteria."
"control procedures were examined through inquiry, document examination and the audit of a small sample of indicators posted online to test the application of the quality controls."
the aeb observed that a workable framework and guidance were developed; the development and update of cesi processes were properly documented; and the review and approvals were properly carried out.
"the controls in place were operating effectively, ensuring that the external reporting of cesi met the quality attributes."
performance data and information in the dpr the department-s annual rpp and annual dpr play an important role in the governmental accountability structure within the expenditure management system.
"they respectively define the plans and performance for each departmental program, in terms of both devoted resources and achievements."
"the 2012-2013 dpr sets out for each program and sub-program a description; the financial resources planned and spent; the human resources planned and used; a table which shows the expected outcome results with related performance indicator(s), target(s) and actual results; and a performance analysis and lessons learned section."
parliament and the treasury board rely on the rpp and dpr as accountability documents in the expenditure management process.
these public documents provide the department-s performance story to parliamentarians and canadians for the departmental programs and sub-programs.
"in order to assess the quality of the data and information reported externally in the dpr, the aeb examined a sample of 18 out of a total of 48 expected results for the 34 programs and sub-programs reported in the 2012-2013 dpr."
"the aeb examined each sample item for its robustness, reliability, accuracy and timeliness."
"a description of the methodology and of each of the information and data quality attributes are listed in annex 1. branch-level management processes and controls the audit looked for branch-specific frameworks, controls and documentation for external reporting consistent with a branch-s share of dpr reporting responsibilities under the existing governance regime."
"in particular, it looked for processes of planning for external reporting, established roles and responsibilities to exercise controls for technical and edit review, and a hierarchy of approvals for branch submission to the dpr."
"the branches relied on their designated coordinators to organize the collection of the required information for submission to the dpr, according to the tbs instructions communicated by the cmd under its annual reporting cycle."
each program or sub-program manager set their own expectations for quality and performed their own technical and edit quality review before giving their approval.
the branches and cmd used emails and a variety of document formats and weblinks to record their work in preparing the dpr.
"sample results for the 18 sample items examined, the aeb observed that four had met all four of the quality attributes and two had met none of the attributes."
the detailed results of the testing have been shared with the respective branches.
"where the robustness of data or information collection methods were poor, this may also have led to a failure to meet the other quality attributes."
"as an example of poor robustness, the expected result in one sample item was -reduced emissions from the implementation of new environmental technologies-."
the aeb selected for audit the performance indicator that stated -annual reduction of emission of air pollutants (criteria air contaminants) resulting from environmental technologies supported-.
the indicator had five specific targets in megatons for the reduction of certain pollutants.
the actual results column in the dpr reported 16 tonnes of total air contaminant reductions in 2012; it also reported that amounts for individual substances were not available.
"eccc needed the input from three external bodies, but only one of those provided data on time to be included in the dpr actual results."
"the performance indicator was the combined level of satisfaction of the four main clients of the meteorological service of canada (msc), including national defence."
the actual results reported included a statement that the number of responses from national defence was too small to be included.
"for others, it was the first time they were being reported and data limitations were not explained."
"as an example of data and information collected that inadequately represented the performance indicator or the expected result, the expected result for a selected item was -compliance with pollution laws and regulations administered by eccc-."
the performance indicator was -compliance with selected regulations reported under this indicator: dry cleaning regulations (initial pilot; other regulations to be added)-.
"the actual results reported in the dpr related to a canadian environmental protection act, 1999 (cepa) dry cleaning regulation (tetrachloethylene use in dry cleaning and reporting requirements) selected for the pilot."
"recognizing the unique challenges posed to the measurement of enforcement actions, the pilot followed a rigorous methodology which produced accurate results."
the program intends to apply the lessons learned in the pilot and measure more regulations in future to more reliably present the performance picture.
"overall, there are material incidences of variability in the data and information reported in the dpr."
dpr sections on performance analysis and lessons learned the information provided in the dpr under the performance analysis and lessons learned section sets out the departmental programs- or sub-programs- highlights for the year.
"these usually do not relate specifically to the stated expected result, but focus on achievements for a variety of initiatives and activities."
the audit selected six highlights statements from the 2012-2013 dpr performance analysis and lessons learned sections for examination from within the previously sampled items.
"because of their level of detail and relation to important program initiatives, these statements are vital to informing the reader of the dpr about the department-s activities."
"recommendations recommendation 1 in cooperation with the responsible program branches, the assistant deputy minister (adm) of the finance branch should provide guidance to assist the branches in ensuring their reported performance information is of acceptable quality and is well documented."
"in doing so, the adm of the finance branch, with the cooperation of the branches, should consider adapting some of the review procedures and tools being used for cesi reporting."
"management response the finance branch agrees with the recommendation, but notes that it regularly provides guidance and assistance to the program branches to support performance reporting."
the finance branch will take steps to provide detailed guidance to program branches to support the preparation of performance information.
"in collaboration with program branches, this will include the examination of review procedures and tools employed by cesi, as well as other leading practices within program branches."
"recommendation 2 the adms of the science and technology branch, environmental stewardship branch, meteorological service of canada, enforcement branch and strategic policy branch should establish effective methods to properly document their submissions and review of performance information for the dpr."
"management responses responses of the science and technology branch, environmental stewardship branch, enforcement branch and strategic policy branch program branches will work with the finance branch to build on existing systems and best practices to establish effective methods to document their performance information submissions, taking into consideration program variations and complexities."
"meteorological service of canada-s response the meteorological service of canada (msc) will continue to build on existing systems and best practices to establish effective methods to properly document their performance information submissions, such as the already established international organization for standardization (iso) 9001 certified quality management system (qms), committing the msc to continuous improvement of its systems and processes."
"included within the qms processes are strong governance and clearly identified accountabilities, such as the multi-branch msc-led director general leads committee and semi-annual management reviews held by the qms steering committee, chaired by the assistant deputy minister of msc."
"overall, the audit found adequate governance was in place at the departmental level for both the departmental performance report (dpr) and canadian environmental sustainability indicators (cesi)."
"however, the governance for the dpr was not sufficiently supported by branch-level management processes and controls to compile, review and document the performance data and information and ensure it is properly approved and presented for submission to the dpr."
"coordination and control of the various performance measurement frameworks in the department, such as for dpr and cesi reporting, did not present any notable difficulties."
"however, there was no additional formal guidance on appropriate management processes and controls to compile, review and document the performance data and information and ensure it is properly approved and presented for submission to the dpr. as observed below in section 2.3 on performance data and information in the dpr, branch processes and controls did not always sufficiently support departmental governance for the production and quality of dpr performance information."
a formal system of lessons learned and follow-up the audit noted that there have been notable improvements in formalizing lessons learned.
"it also looked for appropriate management processes and controls at the branch level to compile, review and document the performance data and information, and ensure the data/information presented for submission in the dpr is properly approved, to sufficiently support the departmental governance over dpr reporting."
"based on the aeb-s examination of the sample items, none of the branches examined had a formal process for ensuring that management properly plan for and review material for external performance reporting."
"for the purposes of the audit, several programs and sub-programs had some difficulty in producing sufficient documentation to demonstrate in a clear manner the work that had been done to acquire and integrate the necessary data and information to prepare their dpr submissions, and how these were subject to appropriate technical review and approval."
"the aeb noted that at the meteorological service of canada (msc), a detailed work instruction is being developed in the context of the branch-s quality management system to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained and the appropriate records are retained."
"although the branch adms approved all program material for submission to the dpr, overall, branch-level management and documentation processes and controls had not ensured consistent adequate quality of the data and information reported in the dpr."
"the following table summarizes the results of the sample: result number of sample items met all attributes met some attributes or would have met with sufficient explanation of the stated result in the dpr met none of the attributes total based on the sample examination, the audit found material (see annex 1 for definition) variability in the robustness, reliability, accuracy and timeliness of the actual results reported in the dpr. as described below, the reasons vary for the number of sample items that did not meet the quality attributes."
"regarding the quality attribute of robustness, in two cases eccc was still trying to find suitable consistent data sources that could be repeatable."
the figure of 16 tonnes was based on the report of the one external entity that reported.
"as an example of a lack of accuracy, the expected result for a selected item was -targeted sectors have the meteorological and environmental information they need to operate efficiently and safely-."
"without the supporting data from national defence, the reported figure of 7.8 out of 10 may not have been accurate."
"another main reason for the information not being reliable was a lack of consistency from year to year: for some samples, the data were collected in a different way or there had been changes to the paa or to the indicator since the previous year; often, there was no explanation provided for the lack of consistency."
"although, the actual result reported a 51% compliance rate, was accurate in relation to that one regulation, the pilot regulation was only one of many regulations under pollution laws administered by eccc referred to the dpr expected result, and this was not fully explained in the dpr. as such, the result stated was not reliable for assessing the achievement against the overall indicator or expected result, which focused more broadly on pollution laws and regulations."
"the aeb found that the controls over the quality of information included in the dpr sections on performance analysis and lessons learned were functioning effectively and ensured the robustness, accuracy and timeliness of the information, with one weakness noted regarding reliability: for all the items selected, the performance analysis was incomplete because the department did not present the achievements being reported in terms of the planned or expected result."
"for example, one highlight stated: carried out over 59,000 compliance promotion activities in 2012-2013, most of which promoted 9 high-priority risk instruments related to two acts: canadian environmental protection act (cepa) 1999 (specifically, the chemicals management plan and the clean air regulatory agenda), and the fisheries act.- although the aeb verified that this statement was robust, timely, accurate and reliable in all other respects, it does not offer the reader any indication as to whether this result was what was expected or whether it was an improvement or setback compared to previous years."
methodologies will be based on guidance from the finance branch with respect to baseline requirements for effective documentation.
these seven findings were related to: composition and role of project steering committees in project governance for the initial implementation of dfms; preparation of agreements to govern the ongoing host-client relationship with aafc; documentation and testing of internal controls over financial reporting; testing of new sap asset management functions by knowledgeable business users at eccc; preparation of the ongoing support organization for sap users at eccc; leveraging the experience gained by the dfms renewal project team prior to april 2015 in upcoming eam phase 2 of the project; and governance of the upcoming eam phase 2 of the project.
"in march 2015, a briefing was provided to the external audit advisory committee (eaac) on the seven findings, as well as comments provided by eccc management on their response to recommendations made by the review team."
"of the seven findings reported during the review, four continue to be relevant to eccc following the sap implementation go-live date of april 1, 2015, as reflected through the remaining recommendations."
"eam phase 2 governance structure and direction continuation of the dfms renewal project to implement enterprise asset management (eam) across all business units at eccc is planned for fy2015-2016 and will be sponsored by the adm, corporate services branch (csb)."
"the review team found that asset management business practices, processes and supporting systems vary widely among business units at eccc, challenging project milestones related to business process definition, data migration, and testing activities for asset management functions."
strong governance over this work will be required in eam phase 2 to ensure that deadlines are met and that tasks are completed.
initiating and sustaining a wholesale change in the culture of the business organizations-i.e. from one where developing and maintaining unique systems and processes is acceptable to one using a common system (sap) and approach-will require top-down leadership over change management activities in the project.
"recommendation 1 the adm, corporate services branch should ensure that proper governance structure and direction for the implementation of the enterprise asset management module (eam phase 2) exists, and that this governance structure includes an active project steering committee."
meetings of this committee should be held at least monthly until sap implementation activities are completed.
"management response corporate services branch response agree - a project plan for eam phase 2 is in progress, describing project deliverables as well as the governance structure required to successfully execute the project plan."
the governance extends from the executive sponsor level down to technical working committees and includes the creation of a project executive committee at the adm level.
the dfms project team recommended to emc in december 2014 that an additional phase of the dfms renewal project be defined to focus on completion of the eam implementation in sap.
"preliminary, high-level estimates of additional funding and human resource requirements were provided to emc in support of the recommendation."
the review team expected to find that planning for this additional work would be structured so that the upcoming eam phase 2 of the project would be continuous with the current dfms renewal project and that key project resources would be retained for eam phase 2 to ensure that knowledge of the work conducted to date would not be lost.
"the review team found that additional project phases were not anticipated in approved project documentation, including the project charter and business case."
"there may be a loss of expertise in terms of asset business processes, their configuration in sap relevant project management processes and lessons learned if there is inadequate knowledge transfer from the current project team."
reduced continuity and a loss of technical knowledge among project personnel could also affect the ability of the eam phase 2 team to accurately estimate the time and cost required to complete the remaining work.
"recommendation 2 the adm, corporate services branch and adm, finance branch should ensure that skills related to technical requirements of assets management functions in sap and to project management skills and practices that were developed by eccc team members during the project prior to april 1, 2015 are retained for the eam phase 2 implementation."
"management responses corporate services branch response agree - the transfer of knowledge between the two projects groups was completed prior to the launch of sap in april 2015. communication between the two groups continues, as the work on ramping up the eam 2 project continues."
formal project management methodologies will be applied to the new project to optimize the delivery of the new system.
"finance branch response agree - where possible, phase 1 resources have been extended into phase 2. knowledge transfer to corporate services branch will be to the greatest possible extent."
"functional readiness this line of enquiry includes review criteria related to: involvement of users in the documentation of business requirements and changes to requirements; certification and accreditation of it security for software applications; and testing the new software system. overall, the review team found that project tasks related to the functional readiness of the new sap-based dfms were well managed."
eccc business stakeholders were involved in the specification of business requirements and the documentation of business processes that were in scope for the dfms renewal project.
"in particular, the review team noted that communities of practice (cops) were established to focus on business change and technical requirements associated with a specific set of business processes, such as procurement-to-payment."
the cops were a communication link between the dfms renewal project team and business units within eccc; each cop was led by a business transformation team lead from the dfms renewal project team.
the review noted that project activities were well coordinated with the aafc sap project team.
"embedding of eccc functional experts with the team at aafc provided strong communication and knowledge exchange, particularly with respect to eccc specific requirements such as those related to asset management."
activities associated with the preparation and migration of legacy data from eccc-s merlin system were adequately planned and monitored.
"one finding, previously communicated to management, was related to the adequacy of user acceptance testing of sap by eccc prior to implementation."
"deployment readiness this line of enquiry includes review criteria related to: the existence of cutover plans and -go/no-go- criteria that must be met for software releases to be implemented into production use; communication of plans by the project team to user communities on the cutover to new systems or new releases of existing systems; plans to help user communities manage the change involving the introduction of a new application system; and project activities related to the development of ongoing support capabilities for users of the new application system. overall, the review team found that project tasks related to the readiness of eccc to migrate to the new sap-based dfms were well managed."
"the dfms renewal project prepared detailed cutover plans and lists of critical go/no-go criteria as controls over decisions and activities related to the migration from its legacy merlin system to sap on april 1, 2015. communications plans and a broad business transformation strategy were also included in project plans, and activities described in these plans were in progress at the time of the review."
"one finding was communicated to management regarding this line of enquiry; it was related to the adequacy of preparations completed to establish an effective user support organization for users of sap at eccc, as summarized in the following paragraphs."
readiness and coordination of eccc support organizations the review team expected to find project tasks intended to set up an effective user support organization for the sap-based dfms to be included in the project plan.
it also expected the support organization to include processes and tools to ensure a seamless coordination with sap support at aafc.
"finally, the review team expected key eccc managers and staff who would operate the support organization to participate in its setup."
"environment and climate change canada reorganized support for its enterprise financial system, migrating from a systems-oriented support model to a client-oriented one."
"the support organization includes a functional help desk to assist users of the system navigate through menus, answer questions about specific transactions or other system features, diagnose error messages encountered during processing, and route requests that cannot be solved to other support organizations (e.g. eccc-s national it help desk, or aafc-s sap help desk)."
"the support organization also provides ongoing sap training and is responsible for maintaining common master data stored in sap and for managing controls over the operation of the system, including those related to the management of system access, assignment of security profiles to users and segregation of duties."
"eccc-s support organization must also be managed to coordinate efficiently and seamlessly with aafc-s sap support organization, so as to provide effective service to eccc-s sap user community, ensure compliance with support principles and standards that are documented in service level agreements (slas) between eccc and aafc, and maintain controls related to the operation of the system."
operational demands are placed on the support organization immediately upon opening the new dfms for production use.
"the review team found that work to develop and implement a support organization for dfms appeared in the project plan, that planned steps were being carried out and that the project team had begun to communicate how the support organization will work."
"in particular, attendees of sap training in early february 2015 received instructions on how to contact support resources."
the review team also found that work associated with the completion of the installation and configuration of the ticket system software to be used by the new support organization had been delayed.
"finally, the review team found that eccc managers identified as responsible for the support organization after implementation had limited involvement in project work related to setting up the support organization."
"recommendation 3 the adm, finance branch and adm, corporate services branch should ensure that support to users through eccc-s support organization is available post-implementation and that support to users is coordinated between the two branches."
management responses corporate services branch response agree - support for clients and stakeholders of eam will be integrated with the support teams in place for the new sap and hrg systems.
finance branch response agree.
"business process readiness this line of enquiry includes review criteria related to: the existence and content of user training programs for sap; and the readiness of eccc-s internal controls over financial reporting (icfr) in the sap environment, the clarification with aafc as to each department-s responsibility for control procedures and the update of control frameworks."
"overall, the review team found that project tasks related to the readiness of eccc to begin using the new sap-based dfms were well managed."
"the review team noted that the training material provided to the team by the aafc sap team had been substantially modified to include eccc-relevant references and exercises, and effective job aids (e.g. an automated merlin-to-sap account code translation tool) were developed and ready for use by the training teams when the classroom sessions began."
"the following finding was communicated to management related to controls, specifically regarding the readiness of eccc-s internal controls over financial reporting."
"update and testing of internal controls since eccc is changing its financial system of record and is modifying the definitions of its major financial business processes, the review team expected to find a stream of activity in the dfms renewal project plan dedicated to the review and assessment of the impact that changes to eccc-s systems and processes would have on its internal controls over financial reporting (icfr)."
"specifically, the review team expected that the scope considered by this stream of work would include the development of control frameworks to support the newly designed eccc-business processes and specific design effectiveness testing relating to those controls and covering business process controls, application security controls, it general controls specific to eccc, controls over interfaces between sap and other systems, and controls over data conversion from existing systems to sap."
the review team found no specific stream of activity in the project plan to review and assess internal controls.
"recommendation 4 the adm, finance branch should ensure that the documentation and testing of internal controls impacted by the sap implementation are completed in a timely manner."
"as part of this recommendation, the adm, finance branch should consider: putting a plan in place to identify controls and document an icfr framework to support eccc-s new, sap-enabled business processes; and ensuring that the scope of internal controls to be documented and tested includes business process controls (including application security), it general controls specific to eccc and controls over interfaces between sap and other systems."
"management response finance branch response agree - the guiding principle for the development of the eccc business processes within a limited timeline was to ensure alignment with the existing internal control maps, treasury board guidelines and the financial management business processes (fmbps)."
"as a result, these processes are a more detailed layer of the fmbps and are open to the development of additional layers, such as the level 4 and level 5 business procedures or practices, and application of the internal control validation and control points."
"overall, the review team found that the project management approach used by the dfms renewal project team was appropriate and that project management controls and practices were applied effectively by eccc."
"strong project management practices related to regular and timely reporting of project status, issues and risks; eccc-s focus on the need to ensure that business process changes were well aligned with the implementation of new sap technology; and the embedding of eccc functional experts with the technical sap team at agriculture and agri-food canada were noted."
"the review, however, did find several exceptions that posed risks to the overall success of the implementation project."
"in all, seven findings on project risks related to eccc-s readiness to begin using sap on april 1, 2015, and detailed recommendations for addressing these risks, were communicated by the review team in its two interim reports to the eccc project team during the course of the review."
"some findings and recommendations were focused on point-in-time risks that were specific to the implementation phase of the project, while others dealt with broader risks to the overall success of the implementation, the ongoing support of the system and its use by eccc."
project management and governance this line of enquiry includes review criteria related to: project management and governance structures; composition and activities of project steering committees; development and maintenance of an overall project plan; management of resources deployed to deliver project tasks; and management of project risks and issues.
"project management activities related to the development and maintenance of project plans were effective, as were the reporting of project risks, project issues, and the status of actions taken to address these risks and issues."
"the review found that although there appeared to be effective oversight of the dfms renewal project by eccc executive management and governance structures, an opportunity for improvement was noted with respect to better representation of all project stakeholders in project governance."
"the review also found that the management of project resources was generally effective; however, a recommendation was made concerning the continuity of project resources for the upcoming eam phase 2 of the project."
"although sponsorship of the project is changing, the review team expects eam phase 2 to be governed effectively and that governance will ensure continuity with project work completed to date."
"as part of this recommendation, the adm, corporate services branch should consider: structuring eam phase 2 as a distinct project with formal governance structures and procedures in place, including a project steering committee led by at least a director general-level executive; ensuring that the project steering committee includes management representatives from the finance branch to maintain continuity with the work of the dfms renewal project completed to date; and, ensuring that the project steering committee meets regularly to review project status, issues and risks, and monitor progress against planned milestones."
"resources for asset management implementation the scope of work to implement sap-s enterprise asset management (eam) functions for eccc represented a higher potential risk to the overall success of the dfms renewal project, due to factors that include: complexity of business processes and variability of business processes among various user communities within eccc; differing technical system requirements among user communities, often dependent on the type of assets managed; a large number of existing legacy asset management software tools, ranging from merlin-s asset lifecycle management (alm) module to simple spreadsheets or other -black book- systems; geographical dispersal of business units and prospective users (i.e. small numbers of users in many locations, including remote locations), complicating participation of some business representatives regarding requirements definition, testing, and training; and aafc did not include eam in its configured sap solution prior to eccc-s partnership on dfms renewal, so eam requirements were -net new- to the technical team and thus required more design, configuration and testing time than other sap modules."
"the review team also noted that the decision to limit the scope of eam work in the initial phase of the project reduced the risk that delays on asset management project activities would threaten the planned implementation of sap at eccc on april 1, 2015."
"however, significant risks to eccc remain regarding the management of the continuation of the work on eam functions."
"in particular, there is a risk that the departure of key dfms project personnel who are scheduled to leave the project after the april 2015 implementation could result in a loss of continuity in the management of the project and a loss of expertise and technical knowledge gained on the project to date."
"as part of this recommendation, the adm, corporate services branch and the adm, finance branch should consider: ensuring that the project manager and key functional business team members from the initial dfms implementation (i.e. on april 1, 2015) work closely with the eam phase 2 project team so that relevant knowledge of business processes, sap configuration, documentation standards and templates, and other lessons learned from the work undertaken to date are not lost; and, ensuring that existing project documentation, expert resources, and any tools and techniques developed to assist the team with project tasks related to business requirements definition, data cleansing, data migration and organizational change management are included in knowledge transfer activities."
"the review team also noted that a stream of project activities was dedicated to ensuring that the sap financial system, hosted by aafc, was assessed by eccc-s it security specialists to ensure that appropriate certification and accreditation of the application was conducted prior to its implementation."
"the review found that test plans included an abbreviated testing approach for sap functions already running in production at aafc, but did not include more detailed user acceptance testing (uat) cycles for enterprise asset management (eam) functions, which were new to the aafc sap environment."
the review recommended that sufficient user acceptance testing for sap functions that were specific to eccc and new to the aafc sap environment be conducted prior to implementation.
"the finance branch indicated that, as the project uses an adopt/adapt approach and the core sap project is already configured, there was no need for user acceptance testing."
"however, a proof of concept was demonstrated to users for eam, and the revised proof of concept was approved by key users (e.g. meteorological service of canada and csb) and is planned to be used as part of training sessions."
the review team also noted that organizational change management plans will be critical to the success of ongoing work related to asset management business functions in eam phase 2.
"gaps in understanding of the support organization-s function, in business procedures to be followed, in staffing of support positions and in the readiness of tools, such as the help-desk service ticket software system, increase the risk that errors or problems experienced by early users of the system will not be addressed efficiently; there is an added risk that the system implementation will be viewed as unsuccessful by the user community."
"as part of this recommendation, the adm, finance branch and adm, corporate services branch should consider: ensuring that work required to complete installation and testing of the assyst ticketing system be reviewed and priorities confirmed by eccc management so that support procedures and related infrastructure are in place prior to first use of dfms in march 2015; ensuring that the project work stream that is dedicated to setting up the operational support function for dfms communicate regularly with managers and lead functional resources responsible for its operation after implementation, so that these stakeholders are aware of the status of project work and that their efforts are coordinated with those of the dfms renewal project team; and ensuring that principles, procedures and infrastructure used in the functional support organization to be operated by the finance branch be adopted by the corporate services branch when a support organization is established for asset management users of sap."
"however, exceptions were noted."
the review team found that the dfms renewal project had appropriately planned and prepared for training courses to be delivered to business users at eccc and that wave 1 training courses (sap users were divided into training cohorts based on their assessed priority for access to the system) were delivered to user communities according to the plan.
evaluations of training courses indicated that the course material was relevant to the training objectives.
the review team also noted that eccc seized the opportunity presented by the implementation of a new financial system to standardize and document business processes to be supported by the new system.
"business process changes, a key component of the dfms renewal project at eccc, included the identification of business process control points in process documentation, but did not include detailed design effectiveness testing of control activities."
"the review team obtained completed business process documentation and noted that control points are captured in revised business process documentation, but did not find that control activities associated with these control points had been formally documented in a control framework to assess the completeness of the controls, nor had they been assessed for design effectiveness."
"overall, the aeb concluded that the department-s existing governance and controls over it security are generally adequate in light of its alignment with the government-s it security policy framework; the establishment of an oversight body for the management of it security; and the existence of a dsp."
it security policies it security policies should be communicated within eccc and aligned with the government of canada's it security policy framework.
eccc-s it security policy and the departmental security policy (dsp) were developed and approved in april 2008 and in october 2011 respectively.
both policies are published on eccc-s intranet along with additional it security directives standards and guidelines.
"(e.g., use of electronic networks)."
"subject-specific directives and notices were also developed, such as the use of web browsers on servers, sharing of classified or protected information with outside organizations, remote access for non-employees, and web surfing while disconnected from econet."
"it security roles and responsibilities for mitigating threats are communicated to employees through: regular reminders and awareness material, such as the network logon (i.e., logon requires confirmation of agreement with the it security policy); periodic newsletters and weekly communiqu-s; and mandatory security awareness training, including it and physical security."
"it security policies, directives, standards, policy notices and procedures are aligned with the government-s it security policy framework in regard to roles and responsibilities and the necessary connections with other departmental it policies and standards as well as legal and regulatory requirements."
"while not required in the treasury board policy on government security, eccc-s it security policy requires a review of the policy at least every five years."
recommendation 1: the assistant deputy minister corporate services branch should consider reviewing eccc-s it security policy in a more timely manner.
"it hr plan though not required by the government-s it security policy framework, as a best practice, there should be an hr plan for it professionals aligned with government-wide and eccc priorities, and communicated to stakeholders."
management response: agreed - eccc-s corporate services branch will review its it security approach.
"in this context, while for all new systems/applications accreditations are completed, for legacy systems, the outstanding 60% will be addressed, with a priority placed on mission-critical systems, using the process to rationalize and migrate systems/applications to the ssc final data centres over the coming three years."
it security plan an it security plan should be developed and aligned with government-wide and departmental priorities and communicated.
reporting on compliance and performance there should be regular monitoring and reporting on policy compliance and it security program performance to inform decision making.
monthly incident reports are produced and contain information about departmental security incidents and are distributed to executive management committee members and tabled at the eaac.
recommendation 3 the assistant deputy minister corporate services branch should ensure that regular monitoring of the implementation of the policy and reporting on the performance of it security activities occur.
management response: agreed - a regular monitoring of the implementation of the it security policy will be conducted and an annual report will be presented to senior management.
oversight of it security an oversight body for the management of it security should be established.
"a departmental security committee has been put in place, supported by terms of reference and records of decisions."
"as well, the dsp and it security policy describe the oversight process and responsibilities specific to the overall management of it security activities."
"different individuals are responsible for the functions of chief information officer (cio), departmental security officer (dso) and the it security coordinator (itsc)."
"it security control there should be control processes for it security to ensure that only approved software are allowed on eccc-s systems (application whitelisting), that these approved software applications are systematically patched (patch management) and that only authorized users can access them (administrative account management)."
"in the context of the ocg-s horizontal audit, the review of security controls was limited to these three key elements."
"application whitelisting while there are no policy requirements for implementing application whitelisting, as a best practice it provides an additional layer of defence as it prevents malicious or unapproved software applications from running."
"patch management an effective application patch management process should include a number of related controls, including identification, categorization, approval, testing and timely patch implementation."
"in csb, applicable patches are identified by it security personnel who continuously monitor for alerts received from the security management software."
"accordingly, applications are patched or upgraded by different teams depending on their category."
"for example, eccc uses automated patch management technology for microsoft software installed on workstations but not for any other software installed on eccc-s computers."
the it security coordinator is informed when security alerts or updates are acted upon.
"while formal test environments for security updates do not exist, csb has adopted an approach where security updates are first deployed to a limited group before being deployed more broadly (i.e. lagged approach)."
this allows for any glitches to be picked up in the initial deployment and to be fixed by the software provider prior to eccc-s full deployment.
administrative account management a key control to prevent unauthorized users from accessing and modifying systems is to ensure that administrative accounts are reserved only for those who need them.
eccc-s im and it security policy and the it access management group services procedural document includes definitions related to privileged accounts.
these documents also provide for a step-by-step description of the management process for domain and local administrative accounts.
"as a best practice, eccc-s privileged access management policies and processes, currently under development, focus on: tasks that require local and domain administrative privileges, and on whom is required and authorized to have them; and the requirements related to the creation of administrator accounts."
"monitoring of the administrative accounts would also improve protection against internal and external threats, and accidental or intentional misuse of privileged access."
"while eccc has implemented some controls in the areas of application whitelisting, patch management and administrative account management, its approach is not integrated and additional controls/best practices would improve overall it security controls."
"recommendation 4 the assistant deputy minister corporate services branch should define an approach and strategy over key control areas, such as: application whitelisting; patch management; and domain and local administrative accounts management."
"management response: agreed - an approach will be defined and a strategy will be established to address the top mitigation measures recommended by cse, and specifically over these three key control areas: whitelisting, patch management an administrative accounts."
"ocg horizontal audit of it security as previously mentioned, aeb-s internal review on it security was conducted in collaboration with the office of the comptroller general (ocg)."
nineteen departments were included in the scope of this audit (12 large and 7 small departments).
"these included departments with central security and/or agency responsibilities (i.e. cse, ssc, tbs, pco, public safety)."
this section provides a summary of the ocg-s results as well as how results of environment and climate change canada compares to other department included in this corresponding audit.
overall the ocg found that elements of governance framework over it security for unclassified government networks were in place but improvements are needed both at the government-wide and department specific levels.
"government-wide, the ocg noted that: policy frameworks are in place but need to be updated to better reflect the government-s current operating environment."
several governance committees have been established but coordination needs to improve.
limited government-wide monitoring of it security is performed.
"the ocg made 13 recommendations, seven of which were addressed to the tbs or ssc, one addressed to small departments only and the remaining (5) to both large and small departments."
the following presents a summary of the recommendations addressed to small and large departments: update it security policies to reflect changes in the operating environment.
regularly monitor and report on the implementation and effectiveness of it security programs in alignment with the secretariat-s requirements.
"eccc is involved by four of the five recommendations outlined above, the exception being recommendation number two. eccc-s performance is consistent with the ocg-s overall results, as large departments on average are targeted by 4 out of the 5 recommendations."
these opportunities for improvement and recommendation are essentially identical to those included in section three of this report.
"conclusion overall, the aeb concluded that the existing governance and controls over it security are generally adequate within eccc."
this participation meant that aeb audit staff conducted the work on behalf of the ocg.
"the objectives, scope and methodology were established by the ocg and the following departments participated: large departments: communications security establishment canada (cse) - as a lead security agency department of finance canada (fin) department of justice canada (doj) environment and climate change canada (eccc) industry canada (ic) parks canada (parks) privy council office (pco) - as a lead security agency public safety canada (ps) - as a lead security agency royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) shared services canada (ssc) - as a shared service provider treasury board of canada secretariat- as a department and a central agency/lead security agency veterans affairs canada (vac) small departments: canadian grain commission (cgc) canadian intergovernmental conference secretariat (cics) canadian nuclear safety commission (cnsc) economic development agency of canada for the regions of quebec (cedq) immigration and refugee board of canada (irb) national energy board (neb) office of the commissioner of official languages (ocol) detailed procedures also provided by ocg included a documentation review and interviews with management (i.e. among others the cio, dso, and headquarters and regional it security coordinators) and information technology staff."
ocg will present a draft report on the results of its horizontal audit in june 2015.
"at the invitation of ssc, eccc accepted to participate in a self-assessment of it-security and disaster-recovery controls."
the results were considered during this review to further substantiate the findings and conclusions.
objectives and criteria the objectives and criteria were as follows: objective criteria overall criteria status governance framework is in place for the management of it security.
it security policies aligned with the government's it security policy framework have been developed and communicated within departments.
partially met an oversight body for the management of it security has been established.
"partially met an it security plan that is aligned with government-wide and eccc-s priorities has been developed, communicated and updated."
met a human resources plan for it security professionals that is aligned with government-wide and eccc-s priorities and plans has been established.
partially met reporting of policy compliance and it security program performance is being done to inform decision making.
controls are in place to ensure that application whitelisting is implemented to help prevent malicious or unapproved programs from running.
not met controls are in place to ensure that patch management for third-party applications and operating systems is implemented.
partially met controls are in place to ensure that administrative accounts are reserved for those that need them to undertake their role.
"not met key dates opening conference (launch memo) november 2013 review plan sent to management august 2014 ocg fact sheets february 2015 review report sent to management may 2015 management response received june 1, 2015 penultimate draft report approved by chief audit executive june 2015 external audit advisory committee recommendation june 2015 receipt of ocg final draft report september 2015 deputy minister approval december 2015"
the audit team also identified the following as some of the areas where it security and controls could be improved.
"it called for: more timely reviews of the it security policy; strengthened risk management processes and plan with respect to the accreditation of it systems and projects; improved monitoring and reporting on the performance of it security activities; and a defined approach and strategy over key controls in the areas of application whitelisting, patch management and administrative accounts management."
"it security governance governance in this context is defined by the ocg as including policies, roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, it hr plan, risk management/security plan; monitoring/reporting on performance; and the oversight process."
the current version has not been updated since april 2008 and does not take reflect the creation of ssc in 2011.
management response: agreed - eccc will proceed with an update and revise as appropriate when ssc clarity is provided on its enterprise responsibilities.
"at eccc, the hr plan for it professionals was not sufficiently detailed to identify current and future needs, monitor movement of those needs and update hr priorities and strategies accordingly."
"management indicated that while an hr plan is important, the evolving ssc transformation with its partner organizations creates a challenge to identify and set hr priorities and strategies to properly address current and future hr needs. in the interim, corporate services branch (csb) has nonetheless developed a service catalog and has aligned it security priorities along with the required resources based on the service needs. in addition, training needs have been established for individuals with significant it security responsibilities."
managing it security risks a formal approach to managing it security risks should be developed and implemented.
"the review identified the following key elements for managing it security risks at eccc: a systematic process to identify, assess, respond, communicate and monitor exposure to it security risks; the dsp includes a description of the it security risk management process and expected results, covers risks related to im and it security, and describes how im and it security management is performed; the eccc-s it plan (2014-15/2016-17) describes related risks along with their likelihood, impacts and key mitigating activities; eccc-s annual departmental corporate risk profile identifies a series of it security risks through the detailed supporting risk analysis; eccc-s im and it security policy describes it security risk management and security awareness and training; and a program on it security awareness and training."
"as well, eccc has adopted the harmonized threat and risk assessment (tra) methodology, developed by the royal canadian mounted police and csec, for the accreditation of it projects and systems."
"csb does not have a formal plan to address accreditation of projects/systems, as tras are currently conducted upon request of program or service managers."
"as a result, of the 190 projects/systems tracked by im and it security between november 2013 and march 2014, 60% have not undergone any security risk assessment."
the lack of a defined risk-based approach and of a formal plan to address accreditation of projects/systems increases the risk that particular threats may not be identified.
recommendation 2 the assistant deputy minister corporate services branch should consider defining a risk-based approach and a plan for the accreditation of eccc-s projects/systems.
"csb-s dsp contains all the major required elements, such as: approval by the deputy minister (dm) and communication to relevant stakeholders; identification of short, medium and long term key it strategic priorities; high-level it security requirements; identification of it security threats/risks and vulnerabilities; supporting guidance and material, including an incident management plan; and description of how eccc-s critical systems are being protected."
"while csb has not regularly conducted a comprehensive review to monitor and report on security compliance and performance, the results of the following activities were monitored: remediation activities related to incident management; certification and accreditation activities and tras; privacy impact analysis; vulnerability management; identification and authentication of users; and malicious code - emails and internet access."
"in the absence of regular monitoring of it security compliance and performance, the department may not be providing adequate protection against changes in the threat and vulnerability environment."
"consequently, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of departmental information may not be fully safeguarded."
"while csb has not conducted a formal review of existing it security oversight in light of the creation of ssc, the department has been adapting its oversight responsibilities on an as-needed basis until the transfer of responsibilities and activities to ssc is fully completed."
"while csb has documented its risk-based patch management process, the security-related patches are not always applied in a consistent and timely manner."
"there are over 1,000 software applications residing on eccc-s networks, and these applications are not all patched or upgraded in a consistent manner mainly because the process is not centrally managed, by, for example, a patch and vulnerability group or the it security coordinator."
the patch management process consists of several sub-processes based on the categories of applications and the hardware they reside on.
"as a result, the patches are not always implemented in a timely manner."
"once patches are implemented, csb does not perform post vulnerability assessments/scans to ensure that the vulnerability has been fully addressed."
"also, patch management status reports are not produced and presented to management for review, with the exception of microsoft patch management compliance reports."
"the lack of a systematic patch management process may result in the department not being able to fully ensure that security-related patches are applied in a consistent and timely manner, which could result in existing vulnerabilities not being mitigated."
"users having administrative account authority have unrestricted, privileged access to systems and can perform a series of tasks that may put the networks at risk."
"domain administrator accounts are monitored by ssc; however, the results of these monitoring activities are not reported to the eccc-s departmental security officer and/or it security coordinator."
"as a result, eccc may not be made aware of intentional attacks or of integrity issues that result from mistakes made by users with elevated permissions."
the ocg-s audit objectives were to determine whether the governance frameworks over information technology (it) security were in place within departments as well as across government; and if selected control frameworks were in place in departments to mitigate it security risks.
a more systematic and integrated it security risk management process which would enhance government-wide planning for securing government systems.
"at the departmental level the ocg noted that: departments it security policies were in place but most needed to be updated; departmental governance structures supporting the coordination of it security activities were mostly in place and align with treasury board-s policy requirements; most large departments had an approved departmental security plan (dsp) covering it security; large departments generally had systematic risk management processes in place for it security; some departments had formal monitoring and reporting frameworks aligned with policy requirements; and control frameworks to ensure effective implementation of application whitelisting, patching of operating systems and third-party applications, and limiting of administrative privileges were not in place."
"ensure that approved departmental security plans are in place and supported by it incident management plans in accordance with the secretariat-s requirement establish systematic it security risk management processes that align with the approach recommended by cse (itsg-33, annex 1)."
"regularly monitor the extent to which departments have implemented the top mitigation measures recommended by cse, and adopt corrective measures to address any gaps identified in consideration of relevant risks."
"the audit team also identified the following as some of the areas where it security and controls could be improved: more timely reviews of the it security policy; strengthened risk management processes and plan with respect to the accreditation of it systems and projects; better monitoring and reporting on the performance of it security activities; and a defined an approach and strategy over key controls in the areas of application whitelisting, patch management and administrative accounts management."
"annex 1: review methodology and criteria methodology the ocg was planning to conduct a horizontal audit of it security and since eccc-s risks assessment revealed most of the same risks, aeb agreed to participate."
"during the planning phase, the review plan was distributed to management for information purposes and management-s agreement of the objectives and criteria was not requested."
"this management self-assessment was intended to provide ssc with a better understanding of the current maturity, potential risks as well as to provide a clearer snapshot of the responsibilities and accountabilities between eccc and ssc."
not met a departmental approach to managing it security risks has been developed and implemented.
"management responses are included and provide: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and, a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan."
"governance structures there are departmental-level governance structures, as well as a program-level governance committee for the oversight of amp md."
"the department has the following oversight bodies in place, which oversee departmental grants and contribution programs, including amp md: departmental management committee; director general management committee; policy and program management committee; and, director general policy and program management committee."
"the departmental management committee and director general management committee provide an oversight role associated with management and operational issues, and the policy and programs management committee and director general policy and program management committee provide an oversight role related to policy and program design."
"the audit team reviewed these governance committees- meeting agendas, records of decision from june 2014 to may 2015, as well as their terms of reference, and determined that these oversight bodies were provided with amp md information and reports."
"at the program level, the director general review committee plays a key role in reviewing proposed projects and their funding allocations, prior to ministerial approval."
"the director general review committee members were provided with project recommendation forms, which summarized the views of the program area and provided key information through technical reviews by up to seven other organizational areas."
management response and action plan: agreed.
"the market development stream began a lean process improvement initiative in october 2015. one of the key objectives of this initiative will be to review and update the program-s collection, presentation, and content of information products going to director general review committee for decision making on project funding; including the development and implementation of a new briefing material format for director general review committee."
"the new briefing format for the director general review committee will provide better, more organized information and stronger analytics supporting the recommendations."
"management controls the amp md has management controls in place throughout the recipient / project lifecycle, including during the assessment of funding applications, contribution agreement approvals, project monitoring, as well as claims submission and payment processes."
"the audit reviewed a sample of 24 successful funding application assessments (28% of 87 generic and small-medium sized enterprises contribution agreements signed between april 1, 2013 and march 31, 2015) and found that: funding application assessments were assessed in accordance with service and program excellence directorate-s assess due diligence guide."
the guide identifies factors to be assessed when reviewing project funding applications.
conflict of interest requirements were respected in accordance with the service and program excellence directorate-s conflict of interest guidelines for grant and contribution programs.
"project funding recommendations and contribution agreements were reviewed and approved through the governance hierarchy to the delegated signing authority as part of the application process, the amp md solicits input from up to seven other organizational areas in the form of a technical review questionnaire."
responses to the questionnaire help support the assessment listed within the project recommendation forms and provides meaningful information to the director general review committee.
response rates ranged from 5% to 90%.
management response and action plan: agreed.
"the market development stream began a lean process improvement initiative in october 2015. one of the key objectives of this lean initiative will be to review and update the process in place for technical reviews; including the development and implementation of an updated technical assessment form (with dedicated questions to specific areas of expertise in other organizational areas), process improvements (e.g.; a technical assessment discussion with technical reviewers on projects before they go to director general review committee) and related guidelines."
"target date for completion: january 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, programs branch and director general, business development and competitiveness directorate the audit also reviewed a sample of 24 claim payment files (57% of the total of 42 claim files between april 1, 2014 to july 27, 2015) and found that: claims were reviewed and approved by the program manager / officer and manager, program operations and financial claims, and were certified pursuant to section 34 of the financial administration act by the delegated authority, prior to section 33 account verification and payment approval by corporate management branch - financial controls, operations."
"claims verification processes were followed, which included ensuring that claims documentation was complete, and that financial updates were received in accordance with contribution agreements."
amendments were signed by the delegated authority and were supported by documented justifications (five such amendments were identified within the sample).
"the audit examined guidance documents developed for amp md and found some were current, for example: amp md applicant guide and recipient guide, and the roles and responsibilities for claim positions; while other guidance documents were not updated for growing forward 2, for example: agrimarketing program - program officer procedures manual (2012), or not compiled, for example; roles and responsibilities of amp md program staff."
"recommendation 3: the adm, programs branch should review and update the internal guidance documents for the agrimarketing program -market development stream."
management response and action plan: agreed.
"the market development stream will update the -agrimarketing program - program officer procedures manual 2012-, which will provide program officer with detailed information/procedures on: the application process, approval process, contribution agreement process, project monitoring/management, project reporting and shutdown."
the agrimarketing market development stream will work with colleagues from other areas in program branch (agriinnovation program) to complete the -guidance document for claims processing -- questions and answers inventory-.
this document will complement the work undertaken on standardization and harmonization with other program areas.
"target date for completion: march 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, programs branch and director general, business development and competitiveness directorate the amp md compiles information on performance against service standards and develops monthly, as well as quarterly reports for management review and decision making."
the audit tested the accuracy and completeness of the main tracking spreadsheet used by program staff to document key milestone dates for application and claim processing.
"the audit team sampled 24 out of 87 generic and small-medium sized enterprises application files from april 1, 2013 to march 31, 2015, and 16 out of 42 claims files from april 1, 2014 to july 27, 2015."
"the audit also examined performance against service standards reports and found that additional qualitative information / analysis (e.g.: how and why variances occurred), would have been beneficial for management review and decision-making."
"recommendation 4: the adm, programs branch should review and update the processes in place to collect, track, and report on agrimarketing - market development stream-s performance against service standards."
response and action plan: agreed.
"the market development stream will work with other areas of program branch to harmonize and standardize service standards collection and reporting, with a view to provide more timely feedback to management on the status of applications and claims."
"the market development stream is developing a sharepoint system that will electronically capture and report on key service standard milestones, as projects move through the technical review and approval process."
the intention is to pilot this initiative for broader application across multiple programs.
"the market development stream has put in place a new claims tracking system (spreadsheet) and created a generic -claims inbox-, with a dedicated position to coordinate the screening and tracking of claims."
"target date for completion: may 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, programs branch and director general, business development and competitiveness directorate annex a: audit criteria adequate program implementation is in place. effective program monitoring and reporting is in place."
"this section presents the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provides recommendations for improvement."
"the audit found that in 6 of the 21 (29%) applications sampled (out of 65 generic files), the project recommendation forms would have benefited from additional project risk and market access information listed within the technical reviews."
"as a result, the information being relayed to committee members via the project recommendation forms may not provide complete information to determine the potential value of proposed projects. recommendation 1: the adm, programs branch should review and update the processes in place to obtain and relay key information to the director general review committee for decision making on project funding."
"target date for completion: january 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, programs branch and director general, business development and competitiveness directorate risk management risk management practices for amp md take place at both the program and recipient / project levels."
"the program utilized the program risk management assessment tool, as developed by the service and program excellence directorate, to identify key program risks."
the audit team reviewed the risk documentation completed by amp md and found that this tool took into consideration key aspects of a program lifecycle and was updated by amp md program staff on an annual basis.
"in addition, the department has a recipient / project risk management framework in place that outlines an approach to identify recipient / project risks and mitigating strategies, which helps to determine advance frequency, holdback limitations, project reporting frequency and claim document sampling percentages."
the audit team sampled 21 amp md application files (out of 65 generic files) and found that all applications had a recipient / project risk assessment that was completed in accordance with the recipient/project risk management framework.
"in a sample of 21 successful funding applications (out of 65 generic files), the audit team found that there was a large variability in the response rate between each organizational area for the completion of technical reviews."
"the varying levels of input within technical reviews may not provide program staff and the director general review committee with complete information to assess proposed projects. recommendation 2: the adm, programs branch should review and update the processes in place to obtain technical reviews, to ensure that a sufficient level of information is gathered from other organizational areas."
"advances, holdbacks and sample selection percentage rates were in accordance with the recipient / project risk assessment."
"in addition, the audit found that the application review and funding decision due diligence process was appropriately followed for the amendments that involved an increase in total project funding and an increase in the agreement period (three amendments of the five)."
"the audit team also observed some inconsistent practices within the file sampling reviews, including: approaches to sampling, and monitoring of project activities and results."
interviews with staff indicated the need for additional guidance on key activities.
"as a result, there is a potential risk of inconsistent practices in the management of recipient files."
"the audit team found that the program area recorded all key application milestone dates accurately, whereas the claim spreadsheet was incomplete, with 8 of 48 claim milestone dates (17%) not recorded."
"appropriate recipient project funding application assessment, award and agreement development processes are in place. effective recipient project funding administration, monitoring and reporting processes are in place."
management responses are included and provide: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan.
it for science acquisitions requiring ssc support aafc is one of 43 organizations competing for demand and supply arrangements with ssc.
"given that science-based research is data-intensive, stb has large electronic storage capacity and data transmission requirements."
"as such, ssc is a key service provider in the delivery of it for science."
interviews noted that stb is not putting forward many new requests to ssc for 2015-2016 because there are a high number of pending requests.
"interviews with stb management noted that in their experience, it can require 6-18 months for requests to be delivered for it for science."
this is resulting in an impact on research projects that are usually only 3 years in duration.
"as an example, one of the requests to ssc that was reviewed by the audit team was for 308 terabytes (tb) of electronic data storage capacity across many aafc research sites."
this request was made to have the electronic data storage capacity augmented to continue research.
the request was made in november 2014.
"as of june 2015, aafc and ssc have not signed a recovery agreement to implement this electronic data storage capacity request."
"as of 2015-2016, aafc is implementing local hard drive encryption that will limit the ability to use usb-connected it storage devices."
"isb management advised the internal audit team that isb is seeking alternatives to authorized storage devices currently being used, such as encrypted portable hard drives and encrypted flash drives."
"as ssc is a key enabler for the acquisition of it for science, the information noted above adds important context to understanding the challenges faced by stb in obtaining the it needed for science research."
recommendations that focus on improving aafc-s processes are identified in the following sections of this report.
long-term it planning to support science sector strategies internal audit expected to find that stb-s science sector strategies were supported by a long-term it plan and that the long-term it objectives were communicated to isb and ssc.
it is a component of the majority of science research in stb and effective planning and acquisition of science-related it is critical to the achievement of the department-s science objectives.
"as a science-based department, aafc is facing significant challenges in ensuring adequate it capacity in the near future."
it planning in stb is focused on addressing immediate needs related to current science projects and the enhancement of research centre capacity.
"a long-term it plan for science, aligned with the science sector strategies, is needed in order to identify the science-related requirements and to inform isb and ssc of the technological capacity required to pursue existing and future science objectives."
"recommendation the adm stb, in consultation with the adm isb, should develop a high-level long-term it plan to document the it needs for aafc science research that is aligned with stb science sector strategies and the adm isb should share the approved plan with ssc."
"management response: agree action plan: stb will develop a long-term it plan, in collaboration with isb that is aligned to stb-s science sector strategies."
the adm integration board approved the creation of an interdepartmental working group to provide ssc with the business and technical requirements for moving forward with a genomics research and development initiative pilot.
aafc staff are participating on this working group in multiple capacities including gilles saindon from stb as one of the three executive sponsors.
"stb, in collaboration with isb, has formed an aafc im/it science tiger team with the mandate to validate and consolidate aafc science computing requirements and to establish a streamlined stb-isb-ssc intake process for identification of current and future science computing requirements."
aafc-s im/it plan is submitted to treasury board secretariat on an annual basis.
"ssc related requirements are captured in this plan, which ssc then uses for its planning purposes."
this is a standard government of canada process for all departments to follow in relation to ssc planned requirements.
aafc will ensure that ssc gets a copy of stb long-term it plan.
"lead(s) responsible: stb: adm, science and technology branch and director general cross-sectoral strategic direction in consultation with other ecozone directors general isb: adm, information systems branch and director general strategic management directorate target date for completion: september 1, 2016 planning for it for science planning process requests for it acquisitions for science research (as well as planned maintenance, upgrades, etc.) are completed by research centre management or scientists."
these requests for it are reviewed by research centre senior management and ecozone directors general and are then submitted to the branch adm for approval before being sent to isb for their consideration in the overall departmental im/it planning.
"isb assesses the information included in the requests, which includes information describing the requirement, any options explored, and the im/it impact of the request."
requests that identify needs that require ssc involvement are directed to the client relationship management unit of isb for submission to ssc.
"for requests that can be implemented by the department, isb project leaders, in conjunction with stb project leaders, identify the procurement requirements and analyze specific options."
"they take into consideration factors such as the technological direction of the federal government, cost, and the impact of maintaining the status quo. when procurements are above $100,000 or sole sourced contracts above $25,000, the standard departmental procurement process is followed, which includes submission of requests to the departmental procurement review board."
"this would include items such as corporately approved, but non-standard, software (e.g. microsoft visio software)."
processes to plan for it for science the treasury board policy framework for the management of assets and acquired services reflects the authority of the deputy head for asset acquisition.
"responsibility for the planning and acquisition of it for science and it-enabled science equipment is further addressed in the aafc policy on planning, managing, and accounting for assets, which describes the managers- responsibility for asset acquisition."
"in 2014-2015, the processes to plan for and acquire it assets were evolving and limited documentation exists to describe the complete planning process from end-to-end and the roles and responsibilities of the key players."
internal audit consulted with management and staff in stb and isb and developed process flowcharts to document the complete processes.
"these flowcharts will also facilitate the identification of areas for improvement such as opportunities to engage partners earlier, as well as, the number and levels of required approvals."
these flowcharts were validated with branch management and provided for future use when developing a framework for the planning of science-related it acquisitions.
"interviews with management and staff from stb and isb indicate that the integration between stb and isb needs improvement, including better notification when calls are made for it requests, more dialogue on cost estimates, and earlier identification of it needs."
"more engagement at the regional level would be seen as positive, in particular during the early proposal development and planning stages."
"as noted earlier, some it for science requests are ssc-oriented."
this includes how to express it needs as a business requirement and how to determine current status of a request.
"recommendation for it for science, the adm stb and adm isb should review and improve the planning process by identifying timeline and approval efficiencies as well as identifying opportunities for the earlier engagement of it partners."
the process improvements should be implemented and integrated into formal guidance that is provided to stb and isb employees.
"management response: agree action plan: in conjunction with isb, stb will develop an it planning process including detailed procedures which will be communicated to all branch personnel."
the planning process will improve efficiencies and identify opportunities for the earlier engagement of isb.
"lead(s) responsible: stb: adm, science and technology branch and director general cross-sectoral strategic direction isb: adm, information systems branch and director general strategic management directorate target date for completion: september 1, 2016 planning for it-enabled science equipment it-enabled science equipment planning process stb management explained that most modern science equipment is it-enabled and is either connected to the departmental network or with a stand-alone computer used for processing."
"it-enabled science equipment purchases are captured via the annual integrated planning call, in-year individual requests to support research projects and in response to a call for the use of unallocated funds in the department."
interviewees stated that not all science equipment procurement is captured in the annual integrated planning process.
"when specific project funding is available, some procurement flows directly from requests by scientists to managers, directors and directors general to procurement."
"under existing planning practices, there is no formal requirement to engage isb prior to the purchase of the equipment."
"information to support planning for the acquisition of it-enabled science equipment aafc-s policy on planning, managing and accounting for assets, requires that decisions related to the acquisition of assets be determined according to specific requirements, linked to departmental priorities and plans."
"it-enabled science equipment can be initially acquired to support specific science projects, and in that case may be purchased using specific project funding."
"once purchased, these pieces of equipment can then be used to support multiple projects at the research centre."
"for acquisitions without project-specific funding, research centres maintain an ongoing list of proposed equipment that is put forward for consideration when other funding becomes available."
these procurements can be made using the research centre budget or in-year unallocated departmental funding.
this list is created or updated by research centre management or scientists whenever called upon to do so by stb-s planning and coordination unit.
it is the responsibility of the research centre management or scientist to assess options and provide relevant detail to research centre management.
the request and approval forms for the above mentioned purchases contain information on the assets to be acquired.
"non-financial information includes items such as: identification of need, link to departmental priorities, identification and assessment of options and the expected benefits/outcomes of acquisitions."
"financial information includes items such as: available budget, initial cost and implementation cost."
"in terms of financial controls, there is some management review of the costing figures."
"for example, management reviews the proposal information to determine if service contracts are good value-for-money."
internal audit determined that the department experiences challenges ensuring that complete information is received in order to make fully informed acquisition decisions.
other challenges related to the planning of it-enabled science equipment noted by internal audit through the conduct of the audit were: no formal isb notification for it-enabled science equipment: planning templates do not specifically identify equipment as being it-enabled or formally require isb review of the proposed it-enabled science equipment.
"information to support life-cycle management for it-enabled science equipment in aafc-s policy on planning, managing, and accounting for assets, asset management is focused on the role that managers must play in the planning, acquisition, management and disposal of assets under their control."
decisions related to potential acquisitions are expected to be driven by specific program requirements.
equipment is tagged with an asset number which is recorded in the departmental financial system by corporate management branch staff assigned to the research centre.
"instead, equipment is identified by research centre staff in response to central requests to identify equipment requirements, usually related to the availability of unallocated departmental funds."
"internal audit determined that if equipment is purchased with an attached computer, it is not physically or uniquely identified with an asset number as it is considered part of the overall equipment acquisition."
"therefore, for computers procured with equipment, there is no readily accessible list of their existence, purchase date or expected useful life to use to make life-cycle management decisions."
"for assets connected to the network, an electronic record exists, through survey software managed by isb."
"internal audit interviewed management and staff from stb and isb to understand how each branch becomes aware of the existence of an it-enabled science equipment asset, in order to manage it over its life-cycle."
respondents in stb and isb were unclear about how science-related it assets were tracked.
there is no policy or procedural requirement for science staff to inform it staff about non-networked it assets or to maintain a list locally.
"life-cycle management is needed to ensure assets are captured, managed and replaced according to an analysis of their useful life."
"recommendation the adm stb, in consultation with the adm isb, should develop a formalized approach to life-cycle management for it-enabled science equipment, including: the development and maintenance of local inventories of existing equipment, including any applicable it components, and monitor the estimated useful life of the equipment for planning purposes."
the involvement of isb in the acquisition of future science it equipment.
management response: agree action plan: stb will work with isb and corporate management branch to develop a formalized approach to life-cycle management for it-enabled science equipment for each research centre.
"as described in recommendation 2, the detailed procedures created in collaboration with isb, will include isb-s involvement in the acquisition of future science it equipment."
"lead(s) responsible: stb: adm, science and technology branch and director general cross-sectoral strategic direction, in consultation with director general mixedwood plains, director general coastal, director general prairie boreal."
"isb: adm, information systems branch and director general strategic management directorate and the director, it client services."
"audit findings and management responses this section presents the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, as well as recommendations for improvement."
"of the 14 active requests in 2015-2016, 10 are carry-overs from 2014-2015. by not communicating the increased it requirements, stb-s current it needs may not be adequately prioritized and planned resources may not be adequate to support stb objectives."
a new request to address new and additional storage needs beyond the initial request has not been sent to ssc for 2015-2016 because the 2014-2015 request remains unimplemented.
"for external storage that is locally purchased, while the lead time to acquire is short, it does not include safeguards to mitigate the risks of theft, data loss, destruction, etc. information of business value should be secured and recoverable, which requires connection to the network and the physical safeguards available through ssc-managed it storage."
aafc-s internal audit-s mandate does not include processes or controls under the responsibility of ssc.
"as a result, isb and ssc are not provided with complete information about the objectives or scope of work over the longer-term."
"based on this assessment, isb develops the im/it plan, which is approved by dmc, and updates the plan biannually."
the im/it planning process described above does not include the acquisition of non-enterprise hardware and software which is managed by isb-s it client services unit.
"at the time of the audit, the policy had not been updated to reflect the relative roles to be played by corporate management branch, stb and isb in the context of departmental and ssc-led processes, however it is currently under review."
interviews within stb indicated that there is a need to clarify the complete process as it is not well understood by stb scientists and management.
interviewees in stb and isb noted the processes to engage ssc are not well understood within stb.
internal audit identified that there are opportunities within the existing process to improve planning by stb in order to get requests to ssc earlier and reduce the risk that stb research project timelines and outcomes may be affected.
"although planning documentation that describes the process end-to-end has not been developed, the audit team observed that consistent practices exist across stb to plan for the acquisition of it-enabled science equipment."
"as research projects tend to have specific funding, scientists may simply proceed with any needed acquisitions and isb may not become aware of such acquisitions until the equipment is on site, if at all."
"internal audit observed that, in practice, stb science staff inconsistently involves local and national isb staff with these acquisitions."
"these decisions should be based on cost-benefit analysis of available alternatives and include a consideration of all costs, including acquisition costs and ongoing operating and maintenance costs (e.g. life-cycle management costs)."
"this practice remains external to the overall branch planning process as there is no certainty that there will be unallocated departmental funds for equipment purchases and as noted earlier, local isb staff are not regularly involved in the preparation of these requests."
the cumulative effect of the lack of consideration and planning for these costs across stb increases the risk of significant unplanned costs arising.
science is highly-specialized and it analysts do not have the scientific knowledge to assess the appropriateness of equipment options proposed.
"however, it analysts can review proposed asset technical data to ensure that any potential issues related to connectivity, it security and capacity are identified and addressed during the planning stages."
"it impact of new science equipment may not be considered prior to purchase: within research centres and as part of the it planning procedures, the research centre management or scientist identifies the impact of an equipment acquisition on the centre-s it capacity."
this information is not subsequently reviewed or confirmed by isb and the accumulated impact of equipment installation on a centre-s it capacity is not measured as a standard component of the it planning process.
"internal audit noted that the 2014-2015 stb business plan notes that stb will be developing a strategic approach, process steps, responsibilities and data collection templates to identify, rationalize and prioritize the replacement of scientific equipment such as laboratory equipment."
"as of june 2015, this strategic approach was not yet in place."
"based on interviews with research centre staff, the financial system asset listing is not used to identify upcoming and future equipment replacements, based on estimated useful life."
"however, if the computer was procured separately (e.g. through isb), it is given an asset number."
"assets that are off-network cannot be surveyed so isb may not be aware of them, or about computers connected to scientific instruments."
"although it-enabled science equipment is not life-cycle managed by stb, the replacement of it equipment can occur when it staff advises stb management that an existing it asset is aging or that capacity is inadequate."
internal audit noted instances of costly reactive rather than proactive maintenance and replacement of the it-portion of it-enabled science equipment.
"target date for completion: september 1, 2016 annex a: audit criteria the governance structure for the acquisition of science-related it ensures that decisions are based on consideration of appropriate financial and non-financial information and key partners are engaged on a timely basis."
"the planning processes for science-related it acquisitions ensures that resources are allocated in a cost-effective manner, taking into consideration available options, associated risks and expected benefits."
completion date for each action) opi direct report for each specific action headquarters should ensure that signing authorities are respected and that the issuance and monitoring of special flight operations certificates for air shows be periodically reviewed to help ensure the process is consistently applied and followed throughout the regions.
"civil aviation plans to implement internal procedures which will include components that address signing authorities, documentation, and reporting."
this will be achieved as follows: civil aviation is currently developing a staff instruction entitled si sur-023 unscheduled surveillance activities.
(december 2016 - approved and published) civil aviation will then provide training to regions (developed from the final staff instruction).
"civil aviation will implement a quality control plan by april 2017. subsequently, qc verification will be integrated to quarterly surveillance reporting by august 2017."
"this will ensure the new formal process is being implemented consistently and its feedback is shared with the regions in a structured process, as required."
17-Aug
this staff instruction will indicate: how and when unscheduled surveillance activities take place (including air shows); provide details regarding documentation accountabilities (e.g. signing processes) and outline appropriate quality control and reporting processes.
(march 2017 - training delivered) march 2017 safety and security headquarters should finalize the development of a formal risk-based approach to carrying out inspections of special aviation events - air shows.
"partnership governance the partnership governance structure was created to enable joint discussion, and the establishment and communication of strategic priorities and objectives (refer to figure 1)."
this committee is composed of representatives from each of the client partners.
"the sap partnership management committee (spmc): director general led standing committee focused on the functionality, operations and management of the sap service for the partnership."
this committee is composed of representatives from each of the client partners.
centre of excellence (coe): aafc-based organization that is responsible to deliver sap system solutions that adhere to the strategic objectives and priorities directed by the spsc and spmc.
the coe provides system development and support services for the sap solution.
"change control committee (ccc): aafc-led group that assists in the assessment, prioritization and scheduling of changes."
client advisor: an individual designated by each client partner to act as the key contact person and liaison to the partnership.
"client partner forums: groups that support the governance by working closely with the centre of excellence to provide operational subject matter expertise to the partnership by helping to plan and prioritize business requirements, identify operational issues and act as a conduit for information sharing and knowledge transfer."
the spsc and the spmc do not meet at frequencies that are in accordance with those specified in the sla.
the sap partnership steering committee met only once during the 15-month audit period (1 out of an expected 3+) and sap partnership management committee met twice during the same period (2 out of an expected 5).
the service level agreement (sla) that specifies the expected frequency of governance meetings was developed at a time when the sap partnership was new to all parties.
"as the partners now have many years of experience and familiarity in working with the sap solution and each other, it is possible that the frequency in the sla no longer reflects the frequency that is required or expected by all partners."
aafc 1 management response: agree action plan: frequency of the governance meeting will be re-assessed jointly during the upcoming dg/adm governance meetings in order to address the needs of the partnership.
the service level agreement will be updated accordingly.
"target date for completion: january 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer it controls it controls are broadly defined as activities performed by persons or it systems, to ensure that the it applications continually operate as designed to support the achievement of business objectives and the integrity of data."
it controls are assessed within two main categories: it general controls (itgcs) and application controls.
"it general controls itgcs represent the broad foundation of the it control environment, and are primarily manual in their operation."
"itgcs traditionally fall within three categories: it change management, user access management and it operations."
results for each category are described in detail below.
"it change management it change management controls are key in supporting the continued operations and evolution of it applications, and contribute to ensuring it applications and supporting infrastructure function as intended in a consistent manner."
"the centre of excellence (coe) is responsible for performing system development and support services, including the prioritizing, planning, designing, developing, testing and implementation of service requests."
"to track changes and control the entire change management process, the aafc coe uses a custom module within sap called the change management system."
functional testing: changes are subject to functional testing by members of the coe.
"change monitoring: the use of super user accounts used to transport changes to production, and other privileged activities related to change management, are effectively monitored by the coe."
"strength: all changes that were examined followed the change management process in a controlled manner, and changes were planned to minimize impact on operations."
"finding within the software development lifecycle, user acceptance testing (uat) (also referred to as end user testing) is an activity in which software is tested by the intended audience or business users prior to being moved into production."
"uat is key within the it change management suite of controls, because it is critical that changes have the intended effect within the context of the impacted business processes."
"aafc 2 management response: agree action plan: in collaboration with the client partners, the change management process will be improved to include consideration of user acceptance testing going forward."
"target date for completion: april 1, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer user access management user access management controls govern how access to applications is restricted, provisioned, modified and removed, to help ensure that only authorized individuals have access to data and related it applications, and have the ability to perform only specifically authorized functions."
strong logical access control environments include a balance of both preventative and detective controls.
"controls pertaining to user access approvals, user access revocation, password requirements and security configuration settings are considered key preventative controls, while detective controls generally consist of periodic review of access rights and monitoring of user activity."
"the aafc centre of excellence (coe) in collaboration with client partners, have developed an effectively designed approval process for new access, which includes definitions of roles and identification of approvers; and the access provisioning process is consistently executed by the coe."
the coe consistently removes access in a timely manner upon receiving requests from client partners.
findings the audit also identified opportunities to improve the user access management control environment.
"while the coe consistently removes access in a timely manner upon receiving requests from client partners, it was observed that the coe is not consistently notified by client partners in a timely manner upon the departure of users."
this is due to each client partners- employee departure process not being well-integrated with sap access removal processes.
"user accounts belonging to employees who have left the organizations could remain active for up to a year, and accessed by unauthorized users (i.e. if account is used frequently enough so that automatic locking due to inactivity after 30 days is not applied)."
recommendation aafc 3/cfia 1/nrcan 1 - each client partner should re-assess its: departure process to ensure that the coe is notified in a timely manner of all departures of employees that have sap access rights.
aafc 3 management response: agree action plan: aafc 3 (first bullet): aafc will re-assess its departure process to ensure that the sap coe is notified in a timely manner of all departures.
"target date for completion: march 1, 2016 lead(s) responsible: assistant deputy minister, corporate management branch action plan: aafc 3 (second bullet): sap coe will communicate and engage with its partners in order to put in place a standard user access review process."
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer cfia 1 management response: agree action plan: the accounting operations group does strive to notify the coe of a departing employee with sap access rights."
the issue is more with employees who leave a position for another within the agency.
the proposed periodic review (below) will help to address those situations.
"while the agency does conduct an intensive sap user review, it is only done annually."
the accounting operations division will conduct either a quarterly or semi-annual review aimed more at the users rather than their roles to ensure that (1) the people are still in the position and that (2) they still requires the sap access held.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director, accounting operations nrcan 1 management response: agree."
"action plan: nrcan has recently implemented a new departure process (march 2015), which is integrated with sap access rights."
"in addition, automated reports will compare sap access information to other systems such as the salary forecasting module and directory of people and services (dps)."
"also, please note that compensatory controls currently exist, whereby user accounts are inactivated if users do not access sap for a period of 90 days."
the key control areas assessed as part of the audit were data backups and scheduled processing (i.e. batch jobs).
the centre of excellence (coe) is responsible for executing key controls related to it operations.
"strength: it operations controls related to data backup and scheduled processing are managed in a controlled manner, and monitoring of automated processing is performed."
application controls application controls are automated in nature and are embedded within business processes (e.g. sap will not allow an unbalanced transaction to be posted).
"in some cases, the descriptions of automated application controls pertaining to business processes of aafc, cfia and nrcan do not accurately align with the sap system-s functionality."
"while minor opportunities for improvement were identified pertaining to the accuracy of documented control descriptions, the audit determined that the automated application controls are designed and operating effectively."
"the list of controls for which there are opportunities to improve the accuracy of the control descriptions, has been provided to management."
a business continuity plan (bcp) enables client partners to respond to business disruptions in order to continue the operation of critical functions and services.
disaster recovery planning is focused on recovering it assets from disasters or disruptions.
"a disaster recovery plan (drp) is a critical component enabling the partnership to respond to incidents and disruptions in order to continue the operation of the sap solution and related it infrastructure, as well as maintain the availability of information at a level acceptable to the client partners."
a drp describes procedures and arrangements in place to recover critical it assets within a predetermined time frame.
"findings as per the sap partnership service level agreement (sla), each client partner is responsible for performing their own business impact analysis (bia) and corresponding business continuity plan (bcp) (if warranted by the bia results) for services supported by sap."
finding 5: business continuity documentation requires updates and improvements so that aafc and cfia are prepared to continue the operation of critical functions and services in a timely manner in the event of a business disruption.
"as per the partnership sla, each member of the partnership has individual responsibilities regarding disaster recovery planning."
"while nrcan and cfia data is replicated and backed up by the same methods as aafc-s data, there are no provisions to provide client partners- personnel workspaces and connectivity at the hot site in the event of a business disruption or disaster."
recommendations aafc 4 - aafc should complete the in-progress business continuity plan refresh to update and approve its business continuity plan to ensure departmental readiness.
aafc 4 management response: agree action plan: the sap business continuity plan is completed and approved at the dg level and will be submitted for final approval.
"target date for completion: december 1, 2015 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer cfia 2 - cfia should reassess the criticality of the sap application."
"if services supported by sap are subsequently determined to no longer be critical, then the business impact analysis should be updated accordingly."
the requirements to continue critical services in the event that the sap and it infrastructure are unavailable should be documented in the the business continuity plan.
cfia should engage aafc to implement arrangements so that its business and it requirements for sap will be met in the event of a disaster.
"the arrangements should be supported by formal documentation describing the agreement, cost model and resources that will be made available to cfia in the event of a disaster."
it will be changed to a mad of 8 to 21 days (level 4) during the next review.
"the most critical service provider supporting the partnership-s sap environment is shared services canada (ssc), as they are responsible for hosting and maintaining the it infrastructure."
"ssc was created on august 4, 2011, and it infrastructure-related services that were formerly performed by aafc were subsequently transitioned to ssc."
the audit assessed service provider governance in the following key areas: disaster recovery planning and it infrastructure change management.
"disaster recovery planning finding it is critical that there is a high-level of communication and coordination between the partnership and ssc, due to ssc-s integral role in disaster recovery."
the audit identified that aafc and ssc do not regularly meet to discuss strategic or operational requirements in support of disaster recovery for the sap environment.
"additionally, due to the relocation of the backup data centre, the primary and backup data centres supporting the sap application are now within close proximity (~5km), which is not aligned with best practices."
"the primary and backup data centres are in close proximity, increasing the likelihood that a particular disaster or disruption could affect both data centres simultaneously, thereby hindering the timely recovery of the sap environment."
"it infrastructure change management finding the audit identified that effective communication channels were not in place for aafc to be advised in a consistent and timely manner of it changes at the infrastructure level that may cause unavailability of the sap application, which prevents advance notice and disclosure to client partners."
"since the creation of shared services canada (ssc), the extent of communication with, and involvement of, ssc personnel in the aafc change management process has decreased, and ssc representatives no longer attend the change control meetings at aafc."
recommendation aafc 5 - aafc should collaborate with shared services canada to formalize service level agreements or other business arrangements so that: the disaster recovery plan (drp) is continually updated to reflect the current environment.
the drp documentation should clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between the partnership and ssc in the event of a disaster.
the location of the backup data centre and hot site is re-assessed and remediated as necessary.
planned infrastructure changes with potential impact on sap availability are consistently discussed with client partners in a timely manner.
aafc 5 management response: agree action plan: aafc will collaborate with ssc to ensure sap service expectations and needs are fully understood and work with ssc to: formalize the periodic review and adjustment to the drp to reflect the current sap environment including the delineation of roles and responsibilities for aafc and ssc in the event of a disaster.
request that the location of the backup data centre (hot site) for sap be re-assessed and remediated as necessary.
define the approach for ssc to have timely discussions with aafc on proposed infrastructure changes with an anticipated impact on sap.

"the governance model created to establish, deploy and monitor the strategic, tactical and operational layers of the sap partnership includes the following structures: the sap partnership steering committee (spsc): assistant deputy minister standing committee that provides leadership and sets the strategic direction of the partnership, and is the final approval body for change, management of escalated issues and risk mitigation."
figure 1 - partnership governance structure finding the audit determined that the partnership governance structure was implemented as designed in the governing service level agreement for the sap solution (refer to figure 1); however areas for improvement were identified.
"attendance was not consistently at the appropriate level, as delegates attended the meetings on behalf of the invitees."
"as a result, there is an increased risk that issues hindering the achievement of strategic priorities and objectives are not identified and resolved in a timely manner."
"finding 1: a governance structure with senior level participation for strategic planning, decision-making and problem resolution is adequately designed and established, however it is not operating as defined in the partnership sla."
"the sap partnership steering committee and the sap partnership management committee do not meet at frequencies that are in accordance with the sla, and attendance was not consistently at the appropriate level (i.e. delegates attended the meetings)."
"recommendation aafc 1 - aafc, in collaboration with the other partners, should strengthen the governance processes by jointly re-assessing the service level agreement (sla) requirements to determine if the required frequency of governance meetings is appropriate based on the needs of the partnership, and update the sla if necessary."
aafc should designate a lead or develop a process to schedule governance committee meetings at the agreed upon frequency and with appropriate representation.
a lead will be designated to schedule governance committee meetings at the agreed upon frequency and with appropriate representation.
"the audit observed that all changes examined followed the change management process as defined in the service level agreement and the change management service agreement, and the following key control points are in place and operating effectively: change initiation: changes are initiated by appropriate personnel based on business or technical operational requirements."
change approval: changes are approved by appropriate personnel before being moved into production.
"segregation of incompatible duties: there is an appropriate segregation of incompatible duties among those involved in key responsibilities: approving, developing and moving changes to production."
"within the partnership environment, uat is of increased importance because there may be nuanced differences to each client partners- business processes that the coe is not aware of; and therefore there is a higher risk that changes may have an unintended effect if not tested by client partners prior to being moved to production."
there is a risk that changes do not meet clients- needs or do not function as intended by all client partners.
"in some cases, the lack of client involvement has resulted in inefficiencies, because additional change requests had to be completed to meet clients' needs."
"recommendation aafc 2 - aafc, in collaboration with the client partners, should augment the change management process to include consideration for user acceptance testing based on risk before changes are made to the sap application and its supporting it environment."
the audit assessed controls in the following key user access management areas: passwords security configuration access to privileged it functions user access monitoring user access provisioning user access removal user access periodic review and certification strengths: password controls are appropriate and aligned with communication security establishment canada-s standards.
key sap configuration and security settings are appropriate.
"privileged it functions at the sap application layer, including access to sensitive transactions, default sap profiles, and sap authorization objects are limited to appropriate individuals."
controls to monitor sensitive and higher-risk users- access rights and activities are effective in design and operation over the audit period.
there is a risk that unauthorized users could access the sap application through departed employees- user accounts.
"it was expected that reviews were performed by appropriate it or business management personnel, at a reasonable frequency and following a risk-based approach so that the level of effort in performing the review was commensurate with the associated risks (e.g. moderate and higher-risk users should be reviewed more frequently than lower risk users, who may only require an annual review)."
"the audit identified that each client partner's periodic user access review is only performed on an annual basis, which is not a sufficient frequency to mitigate risks related to deficiencies in the access removal process (refer to paragraph 2.2.9)."
"finding 4: each client partner's periodic user access review is only performed on an annual basis, which is not a sufficient frequency to mitigate risks related to deficiencies in the access removal process."
"periodic user access review process, and consider adopting a more frequent (e.g. on a quarterly basis) and risk-based approach."
"aafc will re-assess its user access review process and consider adopting a more frequent, risk-based approach."
targeted areas (e.g. accounts payable) may also be used when pursuing a risk-based approach.
"with respect to adopting a more frequent access review process, nrcan will introduce a semi-annual review for higher risk access profiles, such as corporate reporting and section 33 officers."
this additional compensatory control will serve to further mitigate related risk.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director finance and procurement services, finance and procurement branch it operations the objective of it operations controls is to provide a reliable processing environment and mitigate risks related to the loss of it applications and data, and the incomplete processing of information."
the audit determined that the suite of backup controls and redundancy built into the architecture reasonably mitigates the risk related to data backups.
"additionally, controls to identify and resolve deviations from scheduled processing (e.g. batch job failures) in a timely manner are effective in design and operation over the audit period, and access to make changes to the job schedules is restricted to appropriate coe individuals."
"business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning every organization is at risk from potential business disruptions caused by various incidents and disasters, which could include: natural disasters such as tornadoes, floods, blizzards, earthquakes and fire accidents sabotage power and energy disruptions communications, transportation, safety and service sector failure environmental disasters such as pollution and hazardous materials spills cyber-attacks and hacker activity."
"the audit assessed each client partner-s bia and bcp and determined that the latest complete and approved aafc bcp was from march 2012, although a bcp refresh is currently in progress."
there is a risk that aafc is not well positioned to continue business operations in a timely manner in the event of a business disruption.
"for cfia, the business continuity plan documentation provided as part of this audit did not provide for scenarios where the sap application would be impacted."
"nrcan-s business impact analysis did not identify any critical functions or services that rely on sap; therefore, the audit did not expect to find evidence of a business continuity plan and a disaster recovery plan (drp) related to sap."
"the service level agreement between the client partners states that -the cost model for the sap solution does not include disaster recovery planning or business continuity planning-, however -should a client partner be interested in creating a drp with the assistance of aafc, this would be addressed separately-."
"based on the nrcan business impact analysis, this would not impact the ability of nrcan to deliver critical functions or services."
"cfia-s business requirements for sap, as defined in its business impact analysis, may not be met in the event of a disaster."
"however, management has stated that it believes that sap is not a critical service and therefore, the business and it requirements in its business impact analysis are inaccurate."
"finding 6: for the sap application, cfia does not have arrangements in place to enable business and it requirements, as defined in its business impact analysis, to be met in the event of a disaster."
"if sap is confirmed as being critical, then the following improvements to the business continuity plan documentation and recovery arrangements should be made to enable the continuity of critical functions and services: cfia should update the business continuity plan documentation to include scenarios in which sap and it infrastructure is impacted or unavailable."
"target date for completion: july 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director, accounting operations service provider governance partnering with third party service providers can provide significant benefits, such as reduced cost and increased efficiency, however the use of such providers also introduces additional risks that need to be managed accordingly."
the audit determined that the aafc disaster recovery plan (drp) was most recently updated in march 2012 and did not reflect the transfer of data centre responsibilities to ssc.
ssc subsequently changed the location of the sap system's backup data centre from a winnipeg facility to an ottawa facility; however the sap drp has not been updated to reflect the current environment.
"primary and backup data centres should have sufficient separation and differences between geography, climate, seismology, and power grids."
there is a risk that aafc is not well positioned to recover it assets in a timely manner in the event of a disaster.
"overall, there is a risk that contingencies to support disaster recovery are not sufficient to recover from certain types of disasters in a timely manner."
finding 7: the disaster recovery plan does not reflect the current environment or clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between the partnership and ssc.
"although meetings between aafc and ssc occur at the senior management level, there are no change management meetings attended by both ssc and aafc representatives."
finding 8: effective governance structures are not in place in support of consistent and timely communication of changes at the infrastructure level that may cause unavailability of the sap application to enable disclosure to all partners and minimize impacts on operations.
this audit focuses on the control framework for the foreign debt process and its material financial transactions.
the audit objective was to provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of key controls related to the foreign debt process in support of the department-s system of internal controls over financial reporting (icfr).
"the audit concluded that the key controls related to the foreign debt process in support of the department-s system of icfr were effective. specifically, the following good management practices were noted: the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are authorized in accordance with legislative requirements and delegated authorities."

the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are recorded accurately and in a timely manner in the departmental financial system.
the department has effective controls over financial reporting for foreign debt transactions.
the department has an effective ongoing monitoring program in support of the foreign debt process.
"as such, the audit focused on the operating effectiveness of key controls identified in the department-s documented business process and control matrix for foreign debt."
the assessment of operational effectiveness for each audit criterion is categorized as follows: effective all key controls are operating as intended and objectives of the audited process are likely to be achieved.
timely action is required.
corrective action is required immediately.
criterion 1 control rating assessment authorization and delegation the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are authorized in accordance with legislative requirements and delegated authorities.
effective the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are authorized in accordance with legislative requirements and delegated authorities.
the currency act and the financial administration act (faa) authorize the minister of finance to carry out foreign debt transactions.
the faa and subsection 17.2 of the currency act allow the minister to delegate this authority to officers of the department of finance; they also govern the administration of financial transactions related to the disbursement of funds.
the audit examined whether the department-s foreign debt transactions were authorized in accordance with legislative requirements and delegated authorities.
twenty issuances from the random sample of 23 debt instruments were tested to determine whether their issuances and related payments were properly authorized as per authorities derived from the currency act and the faa.
criterion 2 control rating assessment accurate and timely recording in the departmental financial system the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are recorded accurately and in a timely manner in the departmental financial system.
effective the department has effective controls to ensure that foreign debt transactions are recorded accurately and in a timely manner in the departmental financial system.
departments are expected to provide reliable financial reporting that supports transparency and accountability for the spending of public funds.
the foundation of reliable financial reporting is the departmental system of internal controls over financial reporting.
"within this control framework, the accurate and timely recording of transactions is paramount."
the audit tested the effectiveness of the controls in place to ensure accurate and timely recording of foreign debt transactions in the departmental financial system.
"the testing consisted of process walkthroughs and a detailed review of the recording of issuance, interest and maturity transactions associated with the sample of 23 debt instruments."
"these controls were operating consistently with the foreign debt control framework, including the processes to record foreign debt issuances, interest payments, debt maturities payments and collateral swaps and hedges."
"the transactions tested were properly reviewed and authorized to ensure accuracy and were supported by adequate documentation, in particular, the financial recording and reporting from the bank of canada."
all transactions tested were recorded into the departmental financial system in an accurate and timely manner.
criterion 3 control rating assessment financial reporting controls the department has effective controls over financial reporting for foreign debt transactions.
effective the department has effective controls over financial reporting for foreign debt transactions.
departments are expected to provide reliable financial reporting that supports transparency and accountability for the spending of public funds.
the foundation of reliable financial reporting is the departmental system of internal controls over financial reporting.
"such a control framework consists of reconciliations on a periodic basis, as well as other key controls to ensure the integrity and reliability of the financial statements."
the audit conducted tests to assess whether the controls in place for the month-end process were operating effectively.
"the audit reconciled the foreign debt activity in the first six months of 2015-16 between (1) the september 30, 2015 trial balance submitted to the receiver general, (2) sap data and, (3) financial management directorate workbooks that support the recording and calculations for individual foreign debt instruments."
"the financial activity related to the sample of 23 foreign debt instruments was also reconciled against this information, as well as source documents and reporting from the bank of canada."
the key controls tested for the monthly review processes were operating as intended.
"these controls are designed to ensure that departmental records used for financial reporting accurately reflect foreign debt transactions related to canada bills, exchange funds transactions, interest accruals, amortization discounts, exchange funds re-evaluations, hedges, swap collaterals, credit support annexes, cash reconciliations and trial balances."
criterion 4 control rating assessment ongoing monitoring program the department has an effective ongoing monitoring program in support of the foreign debt process.
effective the department has an effective ongoing monitoring program in support of the foreign debt process.

the education and social development programs and partnerships sector (esdpp) has taken steps towards updating its national social programs manual and some al program management processes to provide guidance to regions in implementing the ncbr and al programs.
"in light of provincial and territorial variations in service delivery models, the aandc manual provides some flexibility to regions to ensure programming is aligned to corresponding provincial and territorial programs."
"effective 2014/15, the data collection instruments (dci) had been updated to ensure necessary data is being collected from recipients to support performance measurement reporting."
"in addition to performance information gathered for purposes of reporting against kpis, considerable information is being gathered on ncbr projects (e.g., narrative descriptions on detailed results achieved by every ncbr project) and al programs (e.g., details of services received and funding allocated to every al recipient)."
"while this information is useful for purposes of compliance monitoring, very little compliance monitoring is being performed of recipients."
recommendations the audit team made the following recommendations to improve management controls for the ncbr and al programs: the adm esdpp should review the ncbr program policies and procedures to ensure that funding allocation processes are rigorous and aligned to corresponding provincial/territorial program support levels.
"further, recipients should be required to demonstrate that their selection of ncbr projects aligns to an assessment of their community-s needs and priorities."
the adm esdpp should review and gain an understanding of provincial and territorial programs for both ncbr and al and identify opportunities to better align aandc-s programs and support levels to those of provinces/territories.
"further, to inform potential discussions with possible provincial/territorial partners in each region, aandc should gain an understanding of its existing program delivery gaps and cost variations (e.g., differences in service levels within sub-regions, funding levels for different types of funding agreements, consistency of types of services funded across a region, etc.)"
"the adm esdpp should review processes for validating and consolidating data collected from ncbr and al recipients to improve accuracy, usefulness and timeliness of performance information."
"management response management is in agreement with the findings, has accepted the recommendations included in the report, and has developed a management action plan to address them."
the management action plan has been integrated into this report.
the audit of the ncbr and al programs was identified as an audit priority because of the complexity of both programs.
ncbr and al are two of the five transfer payment programs comprising the social development program at aandc.
they are administered in accordance with the treasury board (tb) policy on transfer payments (ptp) and the tb directive on transfer payments.
"the expected outcome of the social development program is -first nations men, women and children are active participants in social development within their communities-."
the ncbr and al programs are important because they serve the needs of those most vulnerable in the aboriginal population.
"the ncbr serves children in low-income families, while al serves low-income seniors, adults with chronic illness, and children and adults with disabilities (mental and physical) so that they can maintain functional independence."
national child benefit reinvestment: the ncbr is one component of a broader federal/provincial/territorial national child benefit (ncb) initiative.
"aandc is responsible for the ncbr on reserve in collaboration with employment and social development canada (esdc), the lead federal department on the ncb initiative."
"the ncb initiative has two components: a financial benefits component: comprised of the federal canada child tax benefit (cctb) and national child benefit supplement (ncbs), and applicable provincial/territorial integrated child benefits."
these benefits are paid directly to eligible families by the canada revenue agency.
"a reinvestment component - the national child benefit reinvestment (ncbr), which provides services and supports for children in low-income families."
this component is administered by provinces/territories/aandc.
the two components have been designed to work together.
"the ncbs was introduced by the federal government in 1998 so that provinces, territories and first nations could choose to reduce (offset) their social assistance payments by an amount up to the full amount of the ncbs without negatively affecting any family-s overall level of income."
"as per the ncb governance and accountability framework and federal ncb authorities, provinces/territories that choose to offset their social assistance benefit rates/payments by the ncbs are required to put the resulting -savings- toward services/supports for children in low-income families."
"referred to as the -reinvestment model-, the offset mechanism is what generates funds for the ncbr."
"aandc is required to mirror the reinvestment model (i.e., the offset mechanism) of the reference province/territory and an amount equal to the offset must be reinvested into supports and services for children on reserve."
"while aandc must mirror the reinvestment model (offset mechanism) of the reference province/territory, the types of programming provided on reserve and off reserve under the ncbr are different."
"this is deliberate and consistent with the design of the federal, provincial, and territorial ncb partnership initiative."
"provincial/territorial ncbr programming has been designed pursuant to (e.g., adjusted to, and to address gaps in) the suite of services and supports provided by federal, provincial, territorial and municipal bodies off reserve; provincial/territorial ncbr programming has been designed to meet the unique needs of off-reserve communities."
aandc ncbr programming has been designed pursuant to the suite of supports on reserve and to meet the unique needs of first nations.
this design is a strength of the ncb initiative; it allows the ncbr to be adapted to community-identified needs and regional variations in availability of social supports.
aandc ncbr programming activity areas were developed in collaboration with first nations.
"they are periodically reviewed and updated if required, and validated by first nations."
on-reserve ncbr programming continues to differ from off-reserve ncbr activities to avoid duplication of services of programs/benefits that are already available on reserve through other social/health programs.
"for instance, while the provinces and territories have used the ncbr to provide supplementary health care benefits, on reserve most residents receive those types of benefits through first nations non-insured health benefits."
"to use the ncbr on reserve for these health benefits would be direct duplication of an already available support, and would therefore not be an efficient use of government funds."
"at present, the ncbr is not delivered in manitoba, new brunswick or newfoundland and labrador, because those provinces have elected to allow the full ncbs to go directly to families without a corresponding reduction in social assistance benefits."
"accordingly, the ncbr is not administered on reserve in manitoba, new brunswick, or newfoundland and labrador."
"in 1998, the province of quebec and aandc agreed that the quebec child benefit be extended to families on reserve provided that aandc reinvested the savings generated into ncbr supports and services."
aandc provided funding for ncbr on reserve in quebec from 1998 to 2012.
the ncbr no longer operates on reserve in quebec.
"in all other regions, aandc-s ncbr provides funding for community-based supports and services under five activity areas: child care; child nutrition; support for parents; home to-work transition; and, cultural enrichment."
"the expected outcomes include a reduction in the incidence, depth and effects of child poverty."
"on reserve, aandc administers reinvestment funding to first nation communities and organizations that in turn deliver the ncbr supports and services."
actual expenditures reported for ncbr in the 2012/13 departmental performance report were $49.9m.
"in 2013/14, the departmental performance report, actual expenditures were $50.6m and planned expenditures reported in the 2014/15 report on plans and priorities were $54m."
"assisted living: al is a residency-based program, introduced in 1982, that provides funding for non-medical, social support services to seniors, adults with chronic illness, and children and adults with disabilities (mental and physical) so that they can maintain functional independence and achieve greater self-reliance."
"al is an application-based program where persons in need of service/supports request them through a funding recipient (i.e. a delivery agent, such as a first nation in-home care provider, or institutional care organization, etc)."
al is available to individuals ordinarily resident on-reserve who have been formally assessed by a health care professional (in a manner aligned with the relevant provincial or territorial legislation and standards) as requiring services and who do not have the financial means to obtain such services themselves.
"there are four components to the al program: in-home care, adult foster care, institutional care, and the disabilities initiative."
"al-s in-home care provides financial assistance for non-medical personal care for individuals who need assistance with activities of daily living, complementing health canada-s home and community care program which funds medical services on reserve."
al-s adult foster care and institutional care provide funding for eligible individuals in need of personal non-medical care in supported living environments.
al-s disabilities initiative provides funding for projects to improve the coordination and accessibility of existing disability programs and community services to persons living on reserve.
the al institutional care component has experienced -scope creep- where there has been a misalignment between services on and off reserve.
currently al authorities provide for funding for institutional care for individuals with lower care needs.
"aandc has continued to fund using this classification system, while provinces and territories have now evolved their social assistance programming by separating health and social costs across all levels of care."
aandc has consequently taken on the reimbursement of some health-related care costs.
"the expected outcome for al is that in-home, group-home and institutional care supports are accessible to low-income individuals, to help maintain their independence for as long as possible."
actual expenditures reported for al in the 2012/13 departmental performance report were $98.3m.
"in the 2013/14 departmental performance report actual expenditures reported were $99.9m, and planned expenditures reported in the 2014/15 report on plans and priorities were $86.9m."
"table 1: 2013-2014 assisted living expenditures per program component by region, vote 1, 10 and statutory expenses (in millions) at qc on mb sk ab bc yt hq total block funding in-home care institutional care type 1 institutional care type 2 foster care service delivery disabilities initiative admin costs total source: compiled from the aandc financial system by the al and ncbr program."
audit objective and scope audit objective the objective of the audit was to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of program management controls for the ncbr and al programs.
"the scope of the audit included coverage of headquarters program controls and three sampled regions: yukon, saskatchewan and ontario."
"in respect of the design of funding allocation and proposal assessment processes, all regional processes were reviewed and considered."
approach and methodology the audit was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the policy on internal audit and followed the internal auditing standards for the government of canada.
"the audit activities followed included: interviews with key officials at headquarters (hq) in the income support directorate (isd) and operations and quality management directorate (oqm) within the social policy and programs branch (sppb) of education and social development programs and partnerships sector (esdpp), and at the corporate information management directorate (cimd) within the chief financial officer (cfo) sector with responsibility related to the management of the ncbr and al programs; interviews with key officials in the three regions visited during the conduct phase; review of relevant documentation related to the management and delivery of the ncbr and al programs; review of a sample of 16 recipient agreements files across the three regions visited; review of ncbr proposal processes and ncbr / al recipient funding allocation approaches and methodologies for all aandc regions; and, analysis of ncbr and al program spending and performance information."
"selection of regions for site visits as part of the approach and methodology for addressing the audit criteria, as identified in appendix a, three regions were selected for site visits."
"factors in the selection of the regional offices to be visited included: the extent to which the office administers ncbr and al programming; variability in ncbr and al funding levels between 2010/11 to 2012/13; coverage of al programming across the different al sub-programs (e.g., institutional care, in home care, foster care, and disabilities initiative); and inclusion of at least one region having an al sub-component delivered in collaboration with a provincial or territorial government."
selection of ncbr and al recipient files for process walkthrough sixteen (16) recipient agreements and related files were reviewed to gain an understanding of practices employed by regions in administering the ncbr and al programs.
"program policies and procedures esdpp sector has a national social programs manual which serves as a procedural and guidance document for regions implementing social programs, including ncbr and al."
"while the manual seeks to establish principles, parameters and guidelines for implementing the al and ncbr programs, it provides considerable flexibility to regions to ensure programming aligns to the level of support provided by provinces/territories and is sensitive to the circumstances of each region."
an update to the manual is currently in draft format and is scheduled to be finalized in the coming months for implementation in the 2015-16 fiscal year.
"ncbr program policies and procedures while the national social programs manual provides some guidance and parameters to regions on eligible recipients and expenditures, it allows regions flexibility in how they administer programs."
"for example, recipient selection and funding allocation is left to regions and there is no guidance provided on recipient monitoring and compliance."
"considering the degree of flexibility available to recipients in selecting ncbr projects (i.e., any activity which supports child care, child nutrition, support for parents, home to-work transition and cultural enrichment), we expected to find that communities were being asked by aandc, in addition to demonstrating eligibility, to demonstrate due diligence in how they identified community needs and priorities and selected projects that best aligned to their needs."
"we note that we would not expect aandc to judge or evaluate community priorities, but rather ascertain that recipients have set priorities and selected projects in a rigorous and transparent manner that considers their community needs and priorities."
"we note that other aandc funded programs require recipients to following planning processes, examples include child and family services, the urban aboriginal strategy, and capital facilities and maintenance program."
recommendation: the adm esdpp should review the ncbr program policies and procedures to ensure that funding allocation processes are rigorous and aligned to corresponding provincial/territorial program support levels.
"further, recipients should be required to demonstrate that their selection of ncbr projects aligns to an assessment of their community-s needs and priorities."
al program policies and procedures the national social programs manual provides guidance to regions on recipient and expenditure eligibility requirements for al programming.
"as a result, the guidance in the current aandc manual is of limited utility to most regions."
"in response to this gap, esdpp sector is attempting to provide greater guidance in an upcoming update to the manual to address regional variations in program delivery."
"considering the complexity of al programming, esdpp sector hosts frequent al working group meetings involving both hq program staff and regional program staff to discuss and address emerging issues and program implementation challenges."
"at the time of the conduct phase of this audit, we noted that program and regional staff had limited information on service delivery gaps between aandc-s existing al program activities and provincially comparable programming."
exhibit 5: continuum of care exhibit 5: continuum of care it is important to understand that aandc al program activities (in-home care and type i and type ii institutional care) are but two elements of a much broader continuum of care (see diagram at exhibit 5).
"if certain first nation communities are underserved by health care professionals and case managers, there is little aandc can do on its own to ensure that those community members who need al services are assessed and provided with needed services and supports."
"aandc al institutional care, in home care and adult foster care funding may be provided to fn recipients, private institutions or provincial and territorial governments."
we saw limited proactive work to identify underserved areas and communities within regions.
recommendation: the adm esdpp should review and gain an understanding of provincial and territorial programs for both ncbr and al and identify opportunities to better align aandc-s programs and support levels to those of provinces/territories.
"further, to inform potential discussions with possible provincial/territorial partners in each region, aandc should gain an understanding of its existing program delivery gaps and cost variations (e.g., differences in service levels within sub-regions, funding levels for different types of funding agreements, consistency of types of services funded across a region, etc.)"
our findings specific to each of the programs included in the scope of our audit are summarized in sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.
"we observed that reporting requirements placed on ncbr recipients are extensive, going beyond what is necessary for measuring performance."
the length of ncbr reports we reviewed ranged from 20 to 280 pages.
"further, the additional information collected from recipients is generally not being used for purposes of recipient compliance monitoring, calling into question its utility."
we did identify practices in respect of the management of agreements with private institutions and provinces / territories.
program performance measurement the social development programs have developed an umbrella performance measurement strategy (pms) covering all of the aandc social programs.
this pms has a significantly reduced number of key performance indicators (kpis) in comparison to the version that existed prior to 2012-13 fiscal year and focuses on measuring program outcomes using data already available and data that can reasonably be obtained through minor modifications to recipient reports.
we reviewed the most recent departmental performance report and esdpp quarterly report and found that performance against the ncbr and al kpis is not yet being reported for the ncbr and al kpis.
our discussions with esdpp sector indicate that the program staff is working on improving the integrity of data provided by recipients and collated by regions.
"further, some important information will only be available after recipient reports are received for the 2014-15 fiscal year."
"ncbr and al recipient reports, generally referred to as data collection instruments (dcis), are fillable forms that all recipients must complete annually."
"effective fiscal year 2014-15, esdpp sector has amended these dcis with the intent of focusing them on the information required for reporting on the pms."
the additional information collected is useful for evaluating compliance with aandc program requirements and for evaluating the eligibility of specific projects and expenditures undertaken by a given recipient.
"more specifically, the ncbr dci is designed for a specific project as opposed to a summary of all projects completed by a recipient."
some of the larger first nations and tribal council deliver upwards of 30 to 60 projects and submit dcis ranging up to 280 pages.
these ncbr dcis are of such a size that regional program staff and funding services officers cannot easily identify compliance issues and data integrity problems.
"in addition, we understand that modifications have been designed into the income assistance dci to provide aandc with information about the amount of national child benefit supplement (ncbs) offset through income assistance for reinvestment (i.e., supports for children in low-income families) in first nations."
"because ncbr funding is supposed to be equal to the ncbs offsets, knowing the amount of funding being offset will permit aandc regions to better align ncbr funding to provincial / territorial support levels."
"al data collection for the delivery of al, aandc has funding agreements with first nations, tribal councils, private institutions and provincial and territorial governments."
"first nation, tribal council and institutional recipients use a common dci template to submit dcis for the three al programs, in-home care, institutional care types 1 and 2, and adult foster care (al dci)."
new data requirements were added to the al dci for the 2014/2015 fiscal year to facilitate collection of performance information required to report on the program-s updated kpis.
provincial and territorial government agencies who deliver institutional care and in-home care submit invoices and supporting documentation to aandc in accordance with the terms set out in their funding agreements.
"a separate dci exists for the al disabilities, focused on project information and results."
the al dci submitted by other types of recipients requires information on services provided to each individual and includes both personal information and information about the service provided.
"some recipients have raised privacy concerns about personal information being reported in relation to the in home care sub-program, which has led one region visited to only request aggregated information (i.e. information without personal identifiers)."
"during our regional site visits, we noted that the collection and consolidation of data for in home care and institutional care is a time intensive process that includes uploading dcis to aandc-s gcims system as well as manual entry of every data point in these dcis into regional excel spreadsheets."
these regional spreadsheets are then consolidated into a national spreadsheet.
"recommendation: the adm esdpp should review processes for validating and consolidating data collected from ncbr and al recipients to improve accuracy, usefulness and timeliness of performance information."
management action plan recommendations management response / actions responsible manager (title) planned implementation date the adm esdpp should review the ncbr program policies and procedures to ensure that funding allocation processes are rigorous and aligned to corresponding provincial/territorial program support levels.
"further, recipients should be required to demonstrate that their selection of ncbr projects aligns to an assessment of their community-s needs and priorities."
esdpp will work collaboratively with esdc (the federal lead on the ncb initiative) to review the policies and procedures to ensure they best support alignment with program authorities and provincial/ territorial levels of support.
esdpp and sadm ro will ensure that program management supports (e.g. through the management control framework) clearly articulate and support first nation community-based priority-setting of ncbr projects and activities. esdpp and sadm ro will continue to work collaboratively with the strategic policy directorate on the health canada/aandc community development and capacity building framework to ensure that comprehensive community planning is utilized as a tool by all first nations communities to support priority setting.
guidance will be provided in 2015-2016 from psd through the follow-up of the audit on capacity building.
"adm, esdpp, jointly with sadm ro march 31, 2017 march 31, 2016 march 31, 2017 march 31, 2018 the adm esdpp should review and gain an understanding of provincial and territorial programs for both ncbr and al and identify opportunities to better align aandc-s programs and support levels to those of provinces/territories."
"further, to inform potential discussions with possible provincial/territorial partners in each region, aandc should gain an understanding of its existing program delivery gaps and cost variations (e.g., differences in service levels within sub-regions, funding levels for different types of funding agreements, consistency of types of services funded across a region, etc.)"
esdpp will conduct a scan of provincial and territorial programs and levels of support for both the al and ncbr programs.
"esdpp is developing a joint workplan with health canada to identify where there may be gaps in the suite of health and social supports on reserve, and gain a better understanding of opportunities to strengthen the alignment of esdpp and health canada programs with provincial/territorial supports."
"adm, esdpp march 31, 2016 march 31, 2016 the adm esdpp should review processes for validating and consolidating data collected from ncbr and al recipients to improve accuracy, usefulness and timeliness of performance information."
"esdpp will continue to collaborate with audit and evaluation and the information management branch on departmental initiatives to improve the accuracy, usefulness and timeliness of performance information."
the data collection instrument (dci) reporting requirements for recipients of ncbr and al program funding are aligned to the performance management strategy.
"information management systems and processes are established and implemented to efficiently collect, track and report on performance indicators for the ncbr and al programs."
"roles, responsibilities and procedures for the collection, tracking and reporting of performance information for the ncbr and al programs are communicated and understood by program delivery staff."
"information on performance indicators for the ncbr and al programs, including dcis from recipients, is reviewed by program delivery staff for completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and compliance with dci / reporting obligations."
performance information for the ncbr and al programs is analyzed by program staff in order to inform program and recipient management.
"processes and controls are in place to consolidate, analyze and report on performance information for the ncbr and al programs nationally on an accurate, complete and timely basis."
"program management and delivery staff has an understanding of their roles, responsibilities and requirements for the management and delivery of the ncbr and al programs."
a plan is in place to guide medium-term resourcing of the ncbr and al programs (hq and/or regional levels).
criterion #5: adequate learning and development initiatives are provided to program delivery staff to enable the discharge of their responsibilities in support of the ncbr and al programs.
criterion #6: regions proactively work with eligible recipients to make them aware of the al and ncbr programs and support them in program launch and delivery.
"program delivery staff either provides capacity related supports, or ensures that other organizations funded by aandc provide these supports, to recipients that are seeking to implement the ncbr and al programs."
approaches and processes are in place to have ncbr project proposals assessed and funding decisions made in accordance with established procedures.
approaches and processes are in place to have ncbr project proposals assessed and funding decisions made in accordance with established procedures.
"criterion #9: financial and non-financial results are monitored to inform program management, including the reinvestment of recipient funding surpluses, and recipient compliance with funding agreements."
"procedures and requirements for the monitoring of financial and non-financial results of the ncbr and al programs address informing program management, including the reinvestment of recipient funding surpluses, recipient compliance with funding agreements and the spending of funds for purposes intended.. procedures and requirements for the monitoring of financial and non-financial results of the ncbr and al programs are communicated and understood by program delivery staff."
processes and controls are in place to have monitoring of financial and non-financial results of the ncbr and al programs in accordance with established procedures.
"while this flexibility exists, our audit found that aandc generally lacks understanding of provincial service delivery models and gaps in its own regional programs, hindering its ability to design programs that are aligned to those of provinces and territories."
"while considerable attention has been paid by the hq program to updating the performance measurement strategy and recipient reporting templates, data validation and management practices are not yet adequate to ensure completeness and accuracy of data."
"additional challenges exist in gathering relevant information from provincial organizations that administer programs on aandc-s behalf, as their data does not always align to how aandc gathers information."
"esdpp sector recognizes these gaps and, as of the end of 2013/14, had not yet begun reporting against its key performance indicators (kpis) for these programs."
conclusion the audit found that management controls for the al and ncbr programs require strengthening to ensure that the programs are delivered in an effective manner.
"to support the design and implementation of important changes to the al and ncbr programs over the medium term, better information provincial/territorial program models and funding support levels is required. more immediate improvements can be made to ensure that requirements placed on recipients are risk-based and that funding surpluses and ineligible expenditures are identified and managed in a timely manner."
"the adm esdpp should institute a risk-based administrative regime for the ncbr and al programs that is considerate of program-level risks and recipient-level risks. attention should be paid to implementing risk-based regimes for selecting appropriate funding instruments, establishing program and recipient reporting requirements, and performing risk-based monitoring activities."
"background an audit of national child benefit reinvestment (ncbr) and assisted living (al) programs was included in aboriginal affairs and northern development canada-s (aandc) 2014-2015 to 2016-2017 risk-based audit plan (rbap) approved by the deputy minister on february 6, 2014."
"although the province of quebec does not formally participate in the national child benefit initiative, it has developed a similar system of family benefits and supports."
these individuals were identified as type 1 and type 2 clients based on a 1973 federal classification system.
"the audit examined sufficient, relevant evidence to provide a reasonable level of assurance in support of the audit conclusion."
"based on the above analysis, the yukon, saskatchewan and ontario regions were selected for site visits."
"based on the above analysis 16 recipient files were selected, including: four recipients within the yukon region, two with funding for both ncbr and al, and two with funding for al only; six recipients within the ontario region, two with funding for both ncbr and al, two with funding for ncbr only, and two with funding for al only; and six recipients within the saskatchewan region, three with funding for both ncbr and al, one with funding for ncbr only, and two with funding for al only."
conclusion the audit found that management controls for the al and ncbr programs require strengthening to ensure that the programs are delivered in an effective manner.
"to support the design and implementation of important changes to the al and ncbr programs over the medium term, better information provincial/territorial program models and funding support levels is required. more immediate improvements can be made to ensure that requirements placed on recipients are risk-based and that funding surpluses and ineligible expenditures are identified and managed in a timely manner."
"findings and recommendations based on the evidence gathered through examination of documentation, interviews and analysis, each audit criterion was assessed and concluded upon."
"where a significant difference between the audit criterion and the observed practice was found, the risk of the gap was evaluated and used to develop the conclusion and corresponding recommendations for improvement."
"while some changes to the manual are envisioned for the 2015-16 fiscal year, they are insufficient to address gaps identified above."
"we found that, that while guidance provided to regions by hq program reinforces the importance of tying project selection to identified community needs and priorities, we saw no evidence of this in regional proposal assessment practices."
having ncbr projects based on community level needs and priorities would reduce the risk that funded ncbr projects do not address the real needs of lower income families in communities.
"historically, the manner in which the federal government defined al services was aligned to provinces, however provinces and territories have evolved their programs and definitions of services, resulting in substantial differences at present."
"for the social and health care systems to function efficiently, health care professionals and case managers must identify client needs and ensure they are provided with timely and appropriate services and supports."
"furthermore, as a client or patient-s needs move along the continuum of care, it is imperative that a health care professional assess their needs in a timely manner and that a case manager (social worker or health care professional) work with the client to ensure they receive timely and appropriate services and supports."
"in light of this reality, we expected to find that aandc program and regional officials would be performing analyses on the types and extent of services provided to identify and understand gaps in service delivery and thus inform their discussions with health canada and provinces/territories, but found that this analysis has not been undertaken to date."
we found that the recipients being funded were typically those who have been funded for many years and their funding levels are typically set based on historical costs or previous year actual expenditures.
the lack of understanding of provincial/territorial program support levels and aandc programming gaps are most likely resulting in some first nation communities being underserved.
"risk-based program management with an aim to ensure strong accountability for public monies and better results for canadians, the treasury board policy on transfer payments requires that transfer payments be managed in a manner that is sensitive to risk, that strikes an appropriate balance between control and flexibility, and that establishes the right combination of good management practices, streamlined administration and clear requirements for performance."
"the treasury board directive on transfer payments establishes that administrative requirements placed on recipients for a given transfer payment program should be considerate of risks specific to the program, the value of funding in relation to administrative costs and the risk profile of recipients."
there is an opportunity to implement risk-based reporting regimes to reduce the reporting burden by streamlining the information being gathered in ncbr recipient reports.
"by streamlining reports, information could be summarized and made more accessible to regional program analysts, allowing them to review reports and provide advice to the fsos managing the agreements."
"if additional details on projects are deemed necessary, these could be requested from recipients as required, rather than being requested from all recipients."
"al risk-based program management for the three regions included in the scope of our audit, we found limited in-year monitoring of implementation of the al program by first nation recipients and only limited post year-end reviews of recipient reports to identify funding surpluses."
esdpp sector-s oqm is in the process of developing a risk assessment tool to be applied to every recipient of al funding and a compliance tool to be applied in evaluating higher risk recipients.
we understand that oqm plans to train regional staff and implement the risk assessment and compliance regime in regions for the 2015-16 fiscal year.
"based on our review of the proposed processes and tools and the results of our audit work, we found these draft tools to be too broad and burdensome, raising concern about whether they can be implemented by region."
"recommendation: the adm esdpp should institute a risk-based administrative regime for the ncbr and al programs that is considerate of program-level risks and recipient-level risks. attention should be paid to implementing risk-based regimes for selecting appropriate funding instruments, establishing program and recipient reporting requirements, and performing risk-based monitoring activities."
"ncbr data collection our audit found that the ncbr dci includes significant additional reporting requirements, beyond the information necessary to report on program performance."
"during our site visits to regions, we found there is limited review of these dcis and little evidence of a challenge role being played by fsos and ncbr program staff in evaluating eligibility of actual expenditures and alignment of spending with the original recipient project proposals."
"rather, recipients could be asked for this information if they are chosen for a mid-year monitoring activity or post year-end compliance review or audit."
"based on discussions with regions and program staff, we understand that challenges experienced in relation to reporting for income assistance may hinder the completeness and accuracy of this ncbr offset information, thereby impeding the ability of aandc to align ncbr funding to provincial / territorial support levels."
our audit found that information provided pursuant to an arrangement with a provincial agency in one of the regions visited does not align to the performance information needed to report on the program-s kpis.
"based on discussions with region and esdpp staff, we understand that a solution to these challenges has not yet been developed."
"the lack of timely, complete, accurate and consistently presented data impedes reporting on the achievement of kpis and ultimately, program outcomes."
"esdpp will determine the appropriate regional ncbr allocations by applying the reinvestment model of the reference province/territory, by conducting phase 2 of the ncbr costing project."
"as recommended in phase 1 of the ncbr costing project (2013-14), the income assistance data collection instrument has been revised to collect the data required to calculate the appropriate allocations in phase 2."
"esdpp and health canada will gather information that may provide further information and details on programming gaps and cost.. adm, esdpp, jointly with sadm ro march 31, 2016 march 31, 2016 march 31, 2019 the adm esdpp should institute a risk-based administrative regime for the ncbr and al programs that is considerate of program-level risks and recipient-level risks. attention should be paid to implementing risk-based regimes for selecting appropriate funding instruments, establishing program and recipient reporting requirements, and performing risk-based monitoring activities. esdpp will ensure that program management supports are clearly identified to support a risk-based administrative regime (e.g., general assessment tool)."
esdpp will continue to collaborate with audit and evaluation and the information management branch to streamline reporting requirements and implement risk-based monitoring activities.
"adm, esdpp march 31, 2016 appendix a: audit criteria to ensure an appropriate level of assurance to meet the audit objective, the following criteria were developed to address the objective as follows: criterion #1: ncbr and al program risks, including risks at the program and recipient levels, are identified, documented, assessed and addressed."
"risks related to ncbr and al program management are identified, assessed and addressed with appropriate management controls."
appropriate mitigation strategies are identified and implemented based on the results of the general assessment of funding recipients for the ncbr and al programs.
criterion #2: the performance measurement regimes of the ncbr and al programs are appropriately designed to support the measurement of contributions to outcomes.
criterion #3: performance information for ncbr and al programs is reported at an appropriate level and in accordance with the performance measurement strategy.
"criterion #4: guidelines, procedures, tools and ongoing support from headquarters (hq) are appropriate to support regional implementation of the ncbr and al programs."
"manuals, guides, procedures and tools are aligned with program terms and conditions, and include clearly identified roles, responsibilities and requirements for the management and delivery of the ncbr and al programs, and are appropriate given the capacity and experience levels of regional staff."
"program management and delivery staff have sufficient capabilities to manage and deliver the ncbr and al programs, and are provided with appropriate supports from hq as needed."
"program management and delivery staff are provided with sufficient learning, development and mentoring to support management and delivery of the ncbr and al programs in accordance with the program design."
"criterion #7: ncbr and al program funding allocation approaches take into account recipient risk profiles and capacity, and are aligned to program objectives, and terms and conditions. approaches for the assessment of ncbr project proposals, and for funding decisions and allocation of funding to recipients for ncbr and al, take into account recipient risk profiles and capacity and are aligned to program objectives, and terms and conditions. approaches for the assessment of ncbr project proposals, and for funding decisions and allocation of funding to recipients for ncbr and al, are communicated and understood by program delivery staff."
"criterion #8: regions take into account recipient risk profiles and capacity in establishing and managing funding agreements with recipients of ncbr and al funding.. funding agreements with recipients (e.g., types of contractual agreements, agreement controls, frequency and type of reporting, cash management schedule, support to recipients, etc.)"
are established based on consideration of recipient risks and capacity.
funding agreements with recipients are managed based on consideration of recipient risks and capacity.
"monitoring results are reported to appropriate parties, and appropriate program management actions are taken, where required."
"recommendations management response / actions responsible manager (title) planned implementation date the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization should address the need for a senior-level oversight body with a mandate that includes a role in the development, oversight and monitoring of the program-s new strategic plan."
"this new plan should include the establishment of timelines, and a clearly established strategic direction and related objectives, including those following the expiry of fcsap."
a terms of reference (tor) will be developed to establish the northern contaminated sites program (ncsp) steering committee.
the tor will include the elements described in the recommendation.
directors will brief and seek input from the steering committee on a regular basis to deal with hq/regional specific issues.
the steering committee will meet twice a year (or more often if required) to be briefed on key issues.
"assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization terms of reference approved by steering committee by march 31, 2015 the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization should review the current status of the program-s human resources (hr) plan with a view to assessing the strategic implications of staffing scenarios and options."
the northern contaminated sites branch (ncsb) updates its hr plan annually and will continue to do so in the future.
"in light of the strategic plan being developed concurrently, ncsb will ensure that the hr plan aligns with the strategic plan for the branch."
any adjustments resulting from the strategic plan will further be reflected in future hr plan updates.
"assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization hr plan updated by january 31, 2015. strategic plan (2015-2020) to be completed by march 31, 2015 the assistant deputy minister northern affairs organization should take steps to review, update and organize the policies and procedures associated with the management of contaminated sites, including related procurement practices, into a control framework for the management of contaminated sites."
"this initiative should be undertaken with input from the south of 600 program and would serve to address identified gaps, streamline content, and support better alignment with current practices and requirements."
it will also establish a foundation for the development of a department-wide control framework for the management of contaminated sites.
a ncsb management control framework will be developed and implemented in order to ensure an effective system of control over the management of contaminated sites north of 60-.
the framework will be designed in accordance with treasury board secretariat (tbs) guidance and relevant good practice/standards.
the ncsb will include input from led-s south of 60- program.
"the audit criteria were drawn from the management accountability framework, treasury board policies, fcsap requirements as well as aandc-s internal policies and procedures."
"the criteria for the audit were as follows: audit criteria program governance, planning, decision-making and monitoring the program-s governance structure, authorities and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated."
"mechanisms are in place to establish and monitor compliance (including compliance with legislative and policy requirements), financial status and progress against program priorities."
program capacity and capability hr plans and strategies which link to program objectives have been established.
procurement processes have been established and communicated to support the achievement of program objectives.
"policies and procedures to support the effective management of agreements and third-party agreements have been established in alignment with relevant legislative and regulatory requirements, organizational values and treasury board policies."
management of contaminated sites well-designed project management approach/methodology has been established and communicated.
key project management controls are operating effectively.
"it should also support linkages among regional and project-level plans, performance measurement strategies and risk management plans."
"further, as part of the update of the program-s strategic plan, she should take steps to ensure the program's hr plan remains appropriate, achievable and aligned with the strategic direction and related objectives."
"assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization march 31, 2016 appendix a: audit criteria to ensure an appropriate level of assurance to meet the audit objective, criteria were developed to address each of the assertions included within the scope of the audit (as provided in section 2 of this report)."
risk-based planning and decision-making is supported by appropriate information and analysis.
recommendations management response / actions responsible manager (title) planned implementation date the senior assistant deputy minister of regional operations should clarify expectations and implement monitoring activities to ensure all regions are adhering to requirements and responsibilities as described in the capital facilities and maintenance program-s management control framework.
control practices are being reviewed as part of work that is currently underway to revise the capital facilities and maintenance program-s (cfmp) management control framework (mcf).
a revised mcf in q1 2015-16 will be in time for the next cycle of project proposals.
the next version of the mcf will contain a compliance regime: it will clarify expectations and establish requirements and responsibilities for monitoring regional compliance with the mcf.
"cib will then resume the compliance monitoring activities, as per the revised mcf."
consideration should also be given to including the review of first nation maintenance management plans as part of capital project monitoring activities.
a.)
the asset condition reporting system (acrs) process will be used to monitor implementation of mmps.
q2 2015-16 - implement new mmp guide and template for buildings.
the senior assistant deputy minister of regional operations should review the minor capital and operations and maintenance (o&m) funding formula methodologies to identify areas that can be improved or streamlined.
"in addition, any modifications to the minor capital and o&m funding formulas should be implemented and compliance monitored."
the o&m and minor capital reform pilot project in the region of ontario has now been successfully implemented and is currently being implemented in other regions across the country.
"next steps of reforming funding formula methodologies involve, starting in 2015-16, aandc requiring first nations to identify o&m funds for each aandc-funded asset in their first nation infrastructure investment plan (fniip)."
data from the annual fniips will help refine funding-formulae for o&m and minor capital activities (formulae-based activities).
opportunities to leverage information that will be made available through the implementation of the first nations financial transparency act will also be explored over the coming year to assist in enhancing program management and delivery.
"senior adm, regional operations q4 -2014-2015 - fniip to include fns requests for formulae-based funding."
q1 -2015-16 - begin monitoring formulae-based proposals submitted in fniip.
q4 2015-16 - opportunities to leverage the new act have been identified.
"the senior assistant deputy minister of regional operations should continue to seek feedback from regions to prioritize and resolve identified icms issues, and identify and communicate to users an icms champion from within the icms team for ongoing regional and hq support."
consideration should be given to re-examining cfm program business requirements and assessing the capabilities of alternative project management systems in the department.
this item will be addressed as part of the upcoming icms change management and regional user teleconference call in march 2015.
"in the regional icms user teleconference, feedback will be sought from hq and regions to identify, prioritize, and resolve icms-related issues."
"as well, as part of the annual work plan prioritization exercise which will take place in march 2015, we will re-examine all outstanding business requirements for planning of the subsequent years- release schedules."
"we will also conduct a regional feedback / response survey, in q4 of 2015-2016, to gauge the quality and awareness of the availability of technical support provided to the regions and make adjustments to the level of support, if necessary."
"senior adm, regional operations next icms change management prioritization exercise and release: q4 of 2014-2015 regional feedback on icms technical support: q4 of 2015-2016"
consideration should also be given to reviewing control practices to determine continued appropriateness and if any modifications are required.
"the findings that were the basis for this recommendation (the use of design approval requests/project approval requests (dar/par), project risk tool, timelines of regional first nation infrastructure investment plan submissions, etc.) are related to project approval steps."
"senior adm, regional operations q1 2015-16 - approval of revised mcf; q4 2015-16 - compliance regime implemented the senior assistant deputy minister of regional operations should review the project risk assessment tool risk criteria to ensure risk identification definitions are clear and understood."
"the major capital project risk assessment tool, and its guidance notes and definitions, is being improved as part of mcf revisions as described under item #1. b.) a generic maintenance management plans (mmp) guide and template for drinking water and wastewater systems has been developed and a similar product for buildings is under development."
"senior adm, regional operations q1 2015-16 - incorporate the updated risk assessment tool into the mcf."
"part of the assessment will include consideration as to whether any of the requirements could be addressed using alternate departmental systems finally, the hq icms project manager, who is the icms champion, will also ensure that better awareness and communication is channeled to the regions with regards to ongoing technical support."
the department has made progress in recent years in developing national policies for programs which aim to reduce variability in program delivery and funding approaches and streamline recipient reporting requirements.
"for the past two years the department has been, and continues to be, focused on streamlining performance measurement strategies and recipient reporting requirements."
"effective for the 2014-15 fiscal year, this will have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of reports being requested of recipients."
programs and regions are working on rolling-out several new or improved program information systems aimed at centralizing data collection and supporting performance measurement.
"while implementation challenges associated with these systems has resulted in unexpected burden for recipients and regions, they are leading to clear improvements in the completeness and accuracy of data being collected."
"while regions are proactively adjusting their organizational structures and internal role assignments to meet changing program and systems requirements, each region is evolving independent of one another, making implementation of hq-driven program control frameworks and systems challenging. an added complexity is that regions have made different levels of investment in program delivery staff and transfer payment management staff, resulting in varying degrees of program implementation across regions."
"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review and clarify options within existing departmental processes, governance structures, accountabilities, responsibilities and authorities for developing and approving program control frameworks and establish a single window approach to communicating program control frameworks to regions and recipients."
"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should establish a function(s) to provide program design and program management expertise to hq programs that are developing and implementing new and amended program control frameworks."
"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should improve alignment of program data collection instruments with program performance measurement strategies for their respective programs to further streamline data being collected from recipients."
"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review key transfer payment management functions to promote greater consistency across regions, including regional organizational structures, classifications, capacity levels and role assignments. management response management is in agreement with the findings, has accepted the recommendations included in the report, and has developed a management action plan to address them."
a horizontal audit of the management control framework for grants and contributions management has been completed each year since 2010-11.
"this year-s audit focused on the design, approval and implementation of program control frameworks and on recipient reporting requirements."
"aandc makes funding available to first nations and other recipients through grants and contributions (g&c) for the delivery of programs and services, including education, land management, social development and community infrastructure."
"total departmental spending on g&c was $6.4 billion, $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion for the fiscal years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively."
"in 2012-13, $4.4 billion of g&c funding was expended on first nations-focused education, social development and infrastructure programming."
the following table outlines the total g&c program spending by region for the 2012-13 fiscal year: table 1: total program spending by region 2012-13 ($ millions)* nu at qc on mb sk ab bc nt yt hq total education elementary and secondary education post-secondary education social development assisted living family violence first nation child and family service income assistance national child benefit re-investment community infrastructure infrastructure assets & facilities education facilities housing renewable energy and energy efficient water and wastewater infrastructure other aandc g&c programs total data compiled from gcims system in january 2014.
"fncfs program spending includes $24m of funds spent on a small number of other social services, such as day care services."
"aandc-s transfer payment programs are administered in accordance with the treasury board policy on transfer payments and directive on transfer payments, which took effect on october 1, 2008."
"in order to meet the expectations of the policy and directive, aandc-s chief financial officer (cfo) sector established the transfer payments centre of expertise, which has put in place the management control framework (mcf) for g&c in order for the department to effectively manage and monitor g&c programs and ensure compliance to the policy and directive."
"aandc-s cfo is accountable for the overall management of transfer payment funds and, as such, is the custodian of the mcf."
the mcf establishes roles and responsibilities for the delivery of g&c - specifically to program management (the design and implementation of a program) and transfer payment management (operations of a program with recipients).
"the activities required to develop policies, procedures, support tools, it systems and training to effectively roll out a program nationally and manage a program on an ongoing basis."
"transfer payment monitoring & reporting: the activities required to effectively manage funding agreements and to ensure financial and performance data are received, terms and conditions of the agreement are met, and payments are made accordingly."
"in support of the department-s administration of g&c programming, aandc collects reports containing financial and non-financial information from recipients."
approach and methodology the audit was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the treasury board policy on internal audit and followed the internal auditing standards for the government of canada.
"the principal audit techniques used included; interviews with key cfo sector officials with responsibility related to the mcf for g&c; interviews with key officials from the sampled programs at hq and at a selection of regional offices; review of relevant documentation related to the mcf for g&c, program control frameworks and recipient reporting requirements; examination of a sample of recipient reports in three regions; analysis of organizational structures and position classifications of the seven southern aandc regions; and, analysis of spending and reporting data for all aandc regions."
"in order to develop a sampling methodology that addressed the audit criteria, as identified in appendix a, a sample of programs, regions and recipients were selected for testing."
the following outlines the approach used to select samples from each of the three categories.
selection of programs to audit the first element of the sampling methodology considers the programs to be selected for testing.
"factors in the selection of the programs to be sampled included the following: size (dollar value) of programs; recentness of program design/redesign initiatives; and, coverage across program sectors."
selection of regions for site visits the second element of the sampling methodology considered the regional offices to be visited.
"factors in the selection of the regions to be visited included the following: size (dollar value) of selected programs (selected above) funded by regional offices; and, feedback obtained during the planning phase by individuals interviewed at hq and regions."
"to gain an understanding of how all regions are adapting their organizational structures and staff roles, we expanded our interviews from the three regions visited to also include teleconferences with senior departmental officials in the alberta, saskatchewan and quebec regions."
"the audit also included some telephone discussions with a selection of officials from first nation communities, identified in consultation with regional offices."
"while regions are proactively adjusting their organizational structures and internal role assignments to meet changing program and systems requirements, each region is evolving independently of one another, making implementation of hq-driven program control frameworks and systems challenging. an added complexity is that regions have made different levels of investment in program delivery staff and transfer payment management staff, resulting in varying degrees of program implementation across regions."
design of program control frameworks the audit included examination of the design and approval processes used by three programs which have recently undergone changes to their program control frameworks.
"the three programs and the changes undertaken in each include: community infrastructure program (ci) updated its program control framework for major capital investments in 2009, moving to a national first nations infrastructure investment plan and introduced the integrated capital management system (icms) to automate business processes and improve tracking of first nations- infrastructure inventories and conditions."
"in 2013, an update was undertaken of the ci sub-program that funds assessments of the conditions for first nation infrastructure assets (assets condition reporting system (acrs) assessments)."
first nations child and family services (fncfs) program is one of several social programs funded by aandc.
"in 2012-13, the program control framework for all social programs was updated, and some national requirements were instituted for fncfs, including the introduction of a fncfs annual business plan and adjustments to the consolidated annual report for all child and family services agencies."
fncfs is also in the process of introducing a new national system to capture program data (fncfs information management system).
"post-secondary partnerships program (pspp), which funds post-secondary institutions to design and deliver university and college level courses tailored for first nations and inuit students, was updated for an april 2014 roll-out."
changes included a streamlined proposal intake and assessment process and a focus on programming in areas with high demand for labour.
"also, a new information system and reporting regime was implemented in 2013-14 for the post-secondary student support program (psssp) and the university and college entrance preparation program (ucepp)."
"the education information system includes, among other things, a database for entering information collected on first nations students who receive funding to pursue post-secondary education."
a table showing the expected elements of a program control framework are depicted exhibit 1.
"while all three programs have established national-level policies that were subjected to senior-level review and approval, they were generally lacking in most other areas."
"community infrastructure had a reasonably complete control framework for its major capital projects and triennial assessments of on-reserve infrastructure (acrs), but its operations and maintenance and minor capital projects were not well covered."
fncfs also funds evaluations of fncfs agencies on a three-year cycle with a view to supporting continuous improvement.
"firstly, involvement of the chief financial officer (cfo) sector, regional operations (ro) sector, and other corporate functions varied from program to program."
"secondly, it remained unclear as to who was responsible for supporting and challenging the majority of program control frameworks."
"while cfo sector-s transfer payments centre of expertise has core competencies in the areas covered by its financial- and agreement-focused directives, their expertise is admittedly not in program design and implementation."
all program and regional managers interviewed expressed the need for evolving a common approach across the department with respect to the development and implementation of program control frameworks.
"some regions had evolved strong processes and guidance, but there was inconsistency in approach across regions visited for the programs included in the scope of our audit."
"through review of program design processes and interviews we noted that, while programs have traditionally invested most of their salary budgets in policy development expertise, some are moving to increase their program implementation expertise."
"to gain an understanding of how all regions are adapting their organizational structures and staff roles, we expanded our interviews from the three regions visited to also include teleconferences with senior officials in the alberta, saskatchewan and quebec regions."
"in most regions, the fsos continue to be the first line of communication with first nations, are responsible for completing general assessments of recipients, work with communities in crisis, work with recipients in developing default remediation plans, and follow-up with recipients when reports are submitted late."
"in some regions, the fsos retain some agreement management and program management responsibilities (e.g. cfs in manitoba, minor capital projects in ontario, capacity development programs in quebec, assessment of select program reports in some regions, etc.)."
appendix e includes an analysis of where the six types of regional staff are located in their respective regions.
"we also found that the position classification categories (e.g. fi vs. as vs. cr) and/or classification levels (e.g. as-05 vs. as-02) varied from region to region for certain roles, making it challenging for programs and the cfo sector to gauge the level of guidance, training and oversight required by regional staff (see table 4 later in this section)."
"to better understand the capacity of regions to implement program control frameworks, we analyzed each region-s organizational design, resourcing levels and role assignments, focusing on three program areas: social programs; education programs; and, infrastructure programs."
"for purposes of our analysis, we grouped staff into six categories (program officers, funding services officers, other transfer payment management personnel, data entry clerks, community development officers, and compliance officers) according to the functions they perform."
"these functions do not necessarily equate to position titles or organizational units, which bare similar titles."
"for example, positions in education directorates which are focused on data entry or compliance are included in the data entry clerks and compliance officers categories, while program analysts, program officers, managers, directors, and administrative staff in education directorates are included in the education category."
this distinction was necessary because organizational design and allocation of responsibilities differs from region to region.
"where a director had responsibilities in both funding services and programs, their position was distributed equally to two role groups."
table 3 compares the resourcing levels for each of the program and agreement management functions and highlights that certain regions have invested more resources in some functions than others.
"table 4 below shows the classification categories and levels for transfer payment management and administration personnel who perform agreement management tasks such as agreement development, budget management, and quality reviews."
an interesting note is that the alberta region leverages financial professionals to support financial related aspects of agreement development and management whereas other regions employ administration professionals and clerical personnel for these functions.
"additionally, some regions tend to rely more heavily on positions with higher classification levels (e.g. quebec and saskatchewan)."
"table 4: resource levels and position classifications for transfer payment personnel **** at qc on mb sk ab bc financial and audit classifications fi-03 fi-02 fi-01 program administration classifications pm-06 pm-06 pm-05 pm-06 pm-02 pm-06 pm-06 pm-05 pm-04 administrative and clerical classifications as-03 cr-04 as-03 as-02 cr-04 as-03 as-02 as-01 cr-04 as-03 as-02 as-01 cr-04 as-04 as-02 cr-05 as-05 as-04 as-03 as-02 cr-04 total for purposes of our analysis, transfer payment management personnel included individuals with responsibilities such as agreement development, cash flow management and administration of budget adjustments."
"it excluded compliance officers, data entry clerks, program officers, funding services officers and community development officers."
"considering that recipient demographics vary across regional offices, we assessed regional capacity according to the following three other factors: the amount of g&c program dollars administered by the region; the number of first nations and tribal councils with whom the region administers funding agreements; and, the percentage of recipients (first nations and tribal councils) in the region that are in default of their agreements and are undergoing some form of remedial action."
"this analysis highlighted additional discrepancies in regional capacity levels and is included in appendix c. implementation of program control frameworks in regions in section 5.1, we presented our findings related to the design of new and amended program control frameworks and highlighted that elements of the frameworks intended to support regional and community level implementation of programs were lacking."
"in section 5.2, we presented our analysis and findings on regional delivery structures and highlighted how they vary considerably across regions."
"in this section, we examine how these two findings intersect and impact the effectiveness of the implementation of program control frameworks."
"implementation of the infrastructure program control framework infrastructure programming is managed according to four main program areas: major capital projects (new infrastructure or improvements valued at $1.5 million or more); minor capital projects (new infrastructure or improvements valued at less than $1.5 million); operations and maintenance funding to maintain infrastructure; and, triennial assessments of infrastructure conditions (referred to by aandc as asset condition reporting system)."
"regional approaches for delivering minor capital programming varied considerably from one region to the next, with one region applying rigorous oversight and another region providing formula-based funding allocations to all communities with relatively little monitoring of the project or verification of completion."
"two of the regions visited applied full oversight of all minor capital projects funded (from $100 to $1.5 million) to ensure that funds were being used for the intended purpose, with no consideration for the possibility of performing less work where a recipient had a proven track record of delivering projects on time and within scope and budget."
"in consultation with the hq program, this same region was planning to move from a formula-based minor capital program to a proposal-based approach in 2014-15."
"our discussions with the hq program, regional staff and first nations officials suggested that the consideration of the impact on first nations as a result of this new approach could have been improved."
first nations were asked in january 2014 to submit one page proposals for all potential projects on their five year infrastructure investment plans for consideration by the department.
"these philosophies ranged from a belief that aandc capital officers must monitor project implementation to ensure that recipient funds are being expended as agreed upon with aandc, while other capital officers worry that oversight might interfere with the first nation-s responsibility to manage its own projects."
"table 5 below shows the breakdown of positions across regions and demonstrates that some regions invest more heavily in engineering and technical experts, while others invest more in project management and administrative capacity."
"the differences in philosophy and delivery approaches across regions reinforce the need for national processes, tools and training to ensure that first nations are receiving comparable services and opportunities."
"while capacity to prepare and implement these elements of the major capital program control framework is strongest in regions, strong coordination and support would be required by the hq program."
one region visited had addressed many of the gaps in the control framework by developing its own processes and guides for aandc capital officers and recipient project managers.
"while there was national consistency in terms of funding approach, there was little to no national direction or guidance on how to manage the implementation of this program component."
implementation of the post-secondary education program control framework post-secondary education program funding is provided to post-secondary institutions through the post-secondary partnerships program (pspp) and to students of first nation communities through the post-secondary student support program (psssp) and the university and college entrance preparation program (ucepp).
the pspp is being streamlined by focusing federal investments on developing and updating courses in disciplines that are most likely to improve labour market participation for graduates.
"starting in 2014, the pspp program is also moving to a streamlined national intake process with two annual fixed proposal intake dates, march 31 and april 30."
we believe that these program changes will help to better align investments to areas of government priority and foster consistency and efficiency across regions.
"notwithstanding these improvements, we did observe that the implementation of this new program approach was expedited, leaving regional offices and institutions only three months to react and prepare for the new direction."
"for example, a student who has successfully completed a university degree under the program would not qualify for further funding to a college program, but would qualify for funding to a master-s level program."
any funding not claimed by these recipients is made available to all other regional first nations recipients through a call for proposals.
"collection and use of recipient reporting in addition to assessing the design and approval of new and modified reporting requirements, covered in section 5.1 as part of our assessment of the design and approval of program control frameworks, the audit assessed the department-s controls for the collection and use of recipient reporting."
"to this end, we performed sample testing in three regions to examine whether regional personnel are using recipient reports for recipient-level decision making."
"we also examined the issue from the perspective of the hq program and regional program managers to determine whether they are supporting regional personnel with the necessary processes, training and systems to enable the effective and efficient use of reporting."
"table 6 shows that the number of distinct reports requested of recipients, of all reporting intervals, has been reduced by approximately two-thirds between 2011-12 and 2014-15."
we were not able to obtain an analysis of the number of data points being collected year-over-year.
table 6: decrease in recipient reports between 2011-12 and 2014-15** program cluster number of distinct reports required of recipients social education community infrastructure data compiled from gcims system in january 2014.
"the data collection modules for the third system, icms, were fully implemented in all regions visited and some system-generated reports were available to assist in managing recipient agreements."
our regional fieldwork highlighted that aandc fsos and data entry clerks devote considerable amounts of time to following up with recipients on late reports.
we extracted information from the aandc grants and contributions information management system (gcims) on all reports requested of and received by recipients in 2012-13.
"as detailed in exhibit 2, these results varied only slightly for the three main program clusters analyzed."
we also evaluated regional reporting to determine whether regions had different levels of success in collecting reports on time.
"exhibit 3 shows that while some regions have slightly better experiences than others, late reporting and cancellation of reports is a problem across the country."
"we performed additional trend and correlation analysis to determine whether reporting lateness was higher or lower when considering a recipient-s general assessment score, community wellbeing index score, and population size, but found no strong correlation with any of these factors."
"at the time of writing our report, the department was in the process of rolling out streamlined data collection instruments (dcis) to reduce the number of reports required of first nations."
"the reductions are reflected in table 6, found above in this section."
"further, there is no clear understanding of when changes are significant enough to warrant consultation and/or approval outside of the corresponding program sector."
"for programs undergoing a redesign that requires treasury board approval of program terms and conditions, senior executives have ensured that approval occurs at a senior level."
the department would benefit from aggregating some of its program design and implementation expertise into a central function that supports and challenges programs that are developing or amending program control frameworks and/or introducing changes to recipient reports.
"recommendations: the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review and clarify options within existing departmental processes, governance structures, accountabilities, responsibilities and authorities for developing and approving program control frameworks and establish a single window approach to communicating program control frameworks to regions and recipients."
"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should establish a function(s) to provide program design and program management expertise to hq programs that are developing and implementing new and amended program control frameworks."
this was later reinforced through changes to the treasury board policy on transfer payments and directive on transfer payments.
"examples of excessive control include: certain regions require and review proposals and completion certificates for all infrastructure projects, even those valued under $1,000 for recipients with a history of meeting their obligations; requiring that all recipients provide full reporting on post-secondary student spending and graduation results when the information could only reasonably be used for compliance monitoring (i.e. it could not reasonably be aggregated for reporting purposes or performance measurement purposes because cost information and student graduation dates do not align with the aandc funding agreement cycle or the report due date); and, requiring reporting of detailed outputs of all child and family services agencies, regardless of whether compliance activities are planned."
delineation of recipient reporting requirements the audit included examination of the performance measurement strategies (pms) and data collection instruments (dcis) of the three programs included in the audit scope.
"since january 2011, social programs have been updating their performance indicators and dcis to ensure that data is collected from recipients where practical and used to report on program performance."
"during the period of the audit, a departmental initiative was underway to streamline pmss and reduce insignificant indicators and data collection requirements."
"moreover, the heavy burden of entering, reviewing and approving recipient reports leaves regional staff with little time to perform program management and recipient monitoring tasks."
"it also negatively impacts the role of fsos by preoccupying their time with chasing down late reports to avoid funding halts, notwithstanding that most core programs have been deemed essential (see exhibit 4) which restricts funding from being halted."
"recommendation: the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should improve alignment of program data collection instruments with program performance measurement strategies for their respective programs to further streamline data being collected from recipients."
"regional delivery models and capacity levels over the past two decades, regions have evolved different organizational structures, competencies and capacity levels."
"variances are evident in a number of ways, including: different delivery models (matrix-based teams vs. functional units); differences in role assignments between fsos, program officers and other specialists (data entry, establishing program budgets, compliance, reviewing program reports, etc.); variances in staffing levels for programs and transfer payment management functions; different occupational group and classification levels of staff (e.g. engineers vs. project managers, financial professionals vs. administrative professionals); existence of compliance units and the focus of compliance work; existence of community development staff to work with communities in crisis; and varied investments in program guides, tools and systems."
these differences make roll-out of national program control frameworks very challenging.
"firstly, hq programs have difficulty distinguishing among the various roles of regional personnel, particularly as it relates to managing reporting, compliance monitoring, reviewing program reports, and supporting recipients with program implementation."
"secondly, having staff with different competencies and experience levels performing the same activities can make it difficult to determine what training, guidance and other program implementation aids are necessary to support program roll-out."
this is compounded by the reality that certain regions have lower relative capacity in certain programs and functions than others.
"on the basis of the findings of the audit, we believe that the department would benefit from promoting greater consistency in regional organizational structures, classifications, capacity levels and role assignments for certain key transfer payment management functions, including: agreement development and tailoring of recipient cash flow and reporting schedules; determination of initial recipient budget allocations and management of mid-year budget adjustments; data entry for key systems including the education information system, the integrated capital management system and first nations child and family services information management system; providing program advice and expertise to recipients; leading compliance reviews; serving as program and functional experts on recipient compliance reviews; working with communities in crisis and communities in default of their funding agreements; performing ratio calculations on the basis of annual audited financial statements; calculating recipient surpluses and deficits for purposes of managing unexpended funding; and, reviewing and approving recipient reinvestment plans where a recipient has incurred a surplus that is eligible for reinvestment."
"as a result of these discussions, the deputy minister has approved the principle that there should be one committee that oversees the four key elements of g&c management: program design, program management, funding agreement development, and transfer payment management and reporting."
the deputy minister has also decided to launch an overall review of the governance structure of the department.

"the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review and clarify options within existing departmental processes, governance structures, accountabilities, responsibilities and authorities for developing and approving program control frameworks and establish a single window approach to communicating program control frameworks to regions and recipients."
"under the leadership of the associate dm, the chief financial officer, in collaboration with the senior adm, regional operations, the adm, northern affairs organization and program adms will: confirm the terms of reference of the governance structures and accountabilities for the approval of program control frameworks on an on-going basis, in a consistent manner across the department and bring forward to operations committee."
clearly define what a program control framework is and objective / intended purpose and ensure a common understanding.
create an inventory of existing program control frameworks so that adjustments to existing or the development of new frameworks occurs where requested going forward.
"establish a common approach for developing and implementing program control frameworks, including: common elements; and common look and feel."

"the governance structure will ensure that the resulting program control frameworks reconcile the program performance strategies (pms), data requirements for program management and compliance activities, and the requirements of the existing annual report project."
"moreover, as part of reducing the reporting burden, no changes will be made to the reporting guide (data collection instruments), for existing programs, after december 15th each fiscal year, in alignment with the current practice of making the final national funding agreement models available for december 15th."
"chief financial officer senior adm, regional operations adm, northern affairs organization program adms adm, psd q2, 2015-16 the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review regional organizational structures, classifications, capacity levels and role assignments to promote greater consistency across regions for key transfer payment management functions."
"within the framework of departmental decision-making, including the costed-organization chart exercise, and in effort to promote greater consistency across regions for key transfer payment functions, the senior adm, regional operations, regional directors general and the adm, northern affairs organization, with the support of the chief financial officer, program adms and the dg, hrwsb, are undertaking a number of projects to bring a more consistent approach to organizational design and classification in regional offices."
these include the following inter-departmental projects and initiatives: the corporate services review; the compliance review project; the funding services review; the first nation aandc annual report; the block review; and case management.
the timing of each of these projects will be coordinated through the operations committee and other governance bodies of the department.

"the authorities, responsibilities and accountabilities of those involved in the design of program control frameworks (pcfs) are clearly defined and understood (e.g. tpcoe, program management, regional operations, etc.)."
"departmental processes for the design of pcfs consider the feasibility of coordinating and aligning processes, systems and procedures with those of existing tp programs within the department and, to the extent possible, with those of other departments."
"departmental processes for the design of pcfs consider the capacity, adequacy and availability of departmental resources (hr and financial) to meet the operational requirements necessary to effectively deliver the program and achieve its objectives."
"delegated authorities and approval requirements for key elements of the pcf design and approval processes are clearly understood and consistently applied (e.g. funding approaches, new program activities, performance measurement regimes, program administrative regime, etc.)."
"departmental processes for the design of recipient reporting requirements support the development of performance measurement strategies (pms) - including performance measures and indicators that are specific, measurable, relevant and time-bound - that align with the department-s performance measurement framework (pmf) and the outcomes within program terms and conditions."
departmental processes for the design of recipient reporting requirements include consideration of input of first nation recipients to ensure (to the extent possible) that due consideration is given to the impact on first nation and the alignment of these requirements to the information needs of first nations.
"prior to adding new reporting requirements, and in rationalizing existing reporting requirements during program renovation, departmental processes ensure that programs consider the feasibility of using information already available to the department, or available publicly."
"departmental processes ensure that programs periodically re-evaluate recipient reporting requirements, including when changes are made to the pmf and when programs are renovated (i.e. other than minor changes, as prescribed by the policy on transfer payments)."
"criterion #4 processes, tools, systems and learning and development activities are in place and adequate to support the efficient and effective collection and extraction of information from recipient reports."
recipient reporting requirements are clearly communicated to recipients and aandc program delivery staff (i.e. regional and hq staff responsible for direct interface with recipients for purposes of program delivery staff).
"mechanisms (e.g. processes, tools, templates) are established and implemented to support recipients in complying with their reporting requirements."
"guidance, advice, and training is available to program delivery staff and funding services officers (fsos) to support consistency and comparability information across regions and within regions."
"guidance and training where necessary, is available to recipients to support them in understanding and complying with their reporting obligations."
information systems employed to house accountability and performance information (financial and non-financial) support analysis and reporting on expected outcomes.
note: this control objective focuses the alignment of reporting information to program performance indicators and the pms rather than data completeness or accuracy.
"criterion #5: program performance information collected from recipients is consolidated, analyzed and used by programs, and regions where applicable, to measure achievement of program performance indicators and contributions to strategic outcomes."
program performance measurement strategies and other program documentation clearly demonstrate how the performance information collected in recipient reports aligns to and supports performance measurement at the program-level (i.e. required to measure achievement of performance indicators).
"hq programs, with support of regions, consolidate and analyze performance information in support of measuring achievement of performance indicators and contributions to strategic outcomes."
"where program delivery models and program outcomes are distinct at the regional level, regions (with support of hq programs) consolidate and analyze performance information in support of measuring achievement of performance indicators and contributions to strategic outcomes."
"information from recipient financial reporting is analyzed and used by fsos and program officers to support the management of unexpended funds (e.g. reinvestment plans, recovery and reallocation)."
information from recipient reporting is analyzed by fsos and program officers and is used to inform capacity development activities and support extended to recipients.
"information from recipient reporting and other sources is used by regional and hq managers to inform, and revise as necessary, program delivery approaches."
information from recipient reporting and other sources is used by regional and hq managers to inform decision-making in regard to the learning and development requirements of recipients.
information from recipient reporting and other sources is used by regional and hq managers to identify and address the capacity needs of both recipients and regional field officers/fsos.
information from recipient reporting and other sources is used by regional and hq managers to reallocate program funds between recipients (and programs).
"regions are each proactively adjusting their organizational structures and internal role assignments to meet changing program and systems requirements; however each region is evolving independent of one another, making implementation of hq-driven program control frameworks and systems challenging. an added complexity is that regions have made different levels of investment in program delivery staff and agreement management staff, contributing to variability in program implementation."
"while the three programs examined had introduced some of the elements that would be expected in a strong program control framework, they included few risk-based approaches and generally lacked materials and training to support regions and recipients in implementation."
"while the department has made progress in reducing recipient reporting requirements, the audit found that the data collected from recipients is not yet being used to its full potential by regions and programs."
"conclusion the audit found that the department does not take a horizontal approach to designing, approving or implementing program control frameworks."
"while the three programs examined had introduced some of the elements that would be expected of a program control framework, there was considerable opportunity to improve the consistency of approach across programs and the thoroughness of implementation in regions. although the audit found that the department has made progress in reducing recipient reporting requirements for the programs included in the scope of the audit, the data collected from recipients is not being used to its full potential, nor are risk-based approaches being consistently used to target attention at areas of greatest need (e.g. limited risk-based reporting, risk-based compliance reviews and risk-based investments in community development / case management)."
"recommendations the audit team identified areas where management control practices and processes could be improved, resulting in the following four recommendations."
this function could include a blend of existing expertise in program design and regional implementation with expertise in the development of risk-based program management regimes.
"this should include delineating information required for performance measurement from information being collected for possible compliance activities to allow for the application of risk-based reporting regimes (e.g. for projects, programs and recipients)."
"background the audit and evaluation sector of aboriginal affairs and northern development canada (-aandc- or -the department-) identified an audit of the management control framework for grants and contributions in the department-s 2013-14 to 2015-16 risk-based audit plan, approved by the deputy minister on february 27, 2013."
the scope of these audits varies each year based on an assessment of risks during the planning phase of the audit and is designed to focus on a selection of key controls from the department-s management control framework for grants and contributions.
"the policy on transfer payments outlines the expectations that risk-based approaches are adapted to the design of transfer payment programs; the preparation of terms and conditions and funding agreements; and, recipient monitoring and auditing."
"the objective of the policy and directive is to ensure that: transfer payment programs are managed with integrity, transparency and accountability, taking into account the risks; and that programs are effectively focused on citizens and beneficiaries, and are designed to achieve various federal government priorities and expected results."
"the mcf for g&c represents the departmental expectations of how g&c are to be managed across regions and at headquarters (hq), and includes controls grouped into the following four areas, as outlined below: program design & approval: the activities conducted by hq program managers and departmental senior management to design/re-design an effective program based on an identified need and to gain cabinet and treasury board approval."
"program monitoring & reporting: the activities and written directives in place needed to inform program management of performance and financial results and of program level risks, and to monitor the consistent application of program requirements in all regions."
funding agreement development: the activities required to ensure that only eligible recipients are funded and that funding agreements are developed using approved templates that are appropriately selected in order to reflect recipient capacities and risk level.
"this information serves a variety of purposes, including supporting: aandc in measuring the results achieved by its programs, and thus enabling the department to report to parliament on its overall performance; aandc program managers in making program management decisions aimed at optimizing delivery of programming; and, aandc field officers in managing agreements with recipients in a risk-informed manner."
"audit objectives and scope audit objectives the objectives of the audit were to assess: the adequacy and effectiveness of departmental processes in supporting the design and approval of risk-based program control frameworks; and, the adequacy and effectiveness of controls governing and supporting the collection and use of recipient reporting."
"audit scope the scope of the audit covered the period april 1, 2011 to december 31, 2013 and included assessments of: departmental processes which govern the development and approval of program control frameworks, giving particular consideration to whether these frameworks consider program and recipient risks and are designed to achieve maximum integration with other aandc transfer payment management processes, tools and systems; departmental processes for managing the design, approval and rationalization of recipient reporting requirements, while ensuring that sufficient information is being gathered to support the department-s stewardship and accountability reporting obligations; processes for collecting, reviewing and analyzing recipient reports for a sample of three first nation-focused programs (capital facilities and maintenance program; first nations child and family services program; and post-secondary education programs)."
"see section 3.1 for an overview of the methodology used to select the sample; processes for using information gathered from the analysis of recipient reports in making risk-informed decisions, including decisions related to: developing future agreements and defining the nature of the relationship with the recipient; providing support to first nation recipients; monitoring implementation of first nation programs and fulfillment of agreement obligations; and, increasing or decreasing future reporting obligations; and, regional delivery structures and human resource levels for the administration of grant and contribution programs in aandc southern regions."
"the audit examined sufficient, relevant evidence to provide a reasonable level of assurance in support of the audit conclusion."
"based on the above analysis and with the objective being to assess program control frameworks and recipient reporting requirements horizontally across regions and programs, the following programs were selected as part of the conduct of on-site field testing at hq and in the regions: community infrastructure program (capital facilities and maintenance program); first nations child and family services program (fncfs program); and, post-secondary education programs (post-secondary partnerships program (-pspp-),post-secondary student support program (-psssp-) and the university and college entrance preparation program (ucepp))."
"based on the above analysis and with the objective being to assess program control frameworks and recipient reporting requirements horizontally across regions and programs, the following regional offices were selected for on-site field testing: ontario (january 10-14, 2014); british columbia (january 27-31, 2014); and, manitoba (february 10-13, 2014)."
"conclusion the audit found that the department does not take a horizontal approach to designing, approving or implementing program control frameworks."
"while the three programs examined had introduced some of the elements that would be expected of a program control framework, there was considerable opportunity to improve the consistency of approach across programs and the thoroughness of implementation in regions. although the audit found that the department has made progress in reducing recipient reporting requirements for the programs included in the scope of the audit, the data collected from recipients is not being used to its full potential, nor are risk-based approaches being consistently used to target attention at areas of greatest need (e.g. limited risk-based reporting, risk-based compliance reviews and risk-based investments in community development / case management)."
"findings and recommendations based on the evidence gathered through examination of documentation, interviews and analysis, each audit criterion was assessed and concluded upon."
"where a significant difference between the audit criterion and the observed practice was found, the risk of the gap was evaluated and used to develop the conclusion and corresponding recommendations for improvement."
"the fncfs program has introduced a risk-based compliance monitoring tool; however, we found that it had not been implemented in the regions we visited."
"while these reviews were being completed by agencies, we did not see strong examples of the results being used to inform program decisions at the aandc regional and program levels."
"based on our review of the design, change and approval processes applied to each program and our discussions with departmental officials, we determined that processes and responsibilities for undertaking program changes lack clarity."
"likewise, while ro sector-s planning and business integration directorate has some capacity to work with programs undertaking major changes, they lack capacity and depth to support horizontal implementation and are not well positioned in the organization to play a challenge function on new and augmented program control frameworks."
"the audit found that, in the absence of a clear departmental approach, programs concentrated predominantly on developing policies and rules providing limited support to regions and first nations when they implement the programs."
"however, all programs examined in our audit could benefit from shifting resources to hands on implementation expertise and making better use of regional expertise to design practical processes, guides, tools and training materials in support of program design and implementation."
"regional delivery structures and staff roles our audit found that regions have been adapting their delivery structures and internal staff role assignments to address changing program control frameworks, systems, and transfer payment management processes being rolled-out by hq."
"we found that each region is adapting its delivery model in different ways, with most regions moving responsibilities traditionally performed by funding services officers (fsos) to other agreement and program administration personnel (i.e. agreement development, management of recipient budgets and payment schedules, entering recipient reports into systems, assessing recipient reports to determine whether minimum program requirements have been met, and monitoring recipient compliance)."
"the extent to which regions have established dedicated business units and created positions for agreement and program administration tasks appears to be linked in part to their relative size, with smaller regions having less executive and manager positions within which to manoeuver (i.e. maintaining appropriate spans of control for managers and directors has an impact on organizational design)."
"the audit found that the differences in regional delivery structures and staff roles add complexity to the roll-out of program control frameworks, new systems, reporting changes and updates to transfer payment processes (e.g. compliance activities, recipient reinvestment plans for surplus funds on fixed agreements, etc.) we found that hq program managers and other hq-based functions are not always clear about whom to consult or brief in regions on changes and ongoing implementation issues, often providing briefings to regional program managers when it is the fsos, heads of data units, or transfer payment management personnel who would benefit most from being consulted or briefed."

position data extracted from aandc hr information system and compiled based on consultations with regional officials.
"in general, we found that regions have adapted different approaches to implementing the three programs examined in the scope of the audit."
"accordingly, we focused our comparative analysis on the community infrastructure and post-secondary education programs, which are not striving to mirror provincial models and do permit meaningful comparison across regions."
"for all three regions visited (ontario, manitoba and british columbia), we found that major capital projects ($1.5 to $10 million) and triennial asset condition assessments were being managed according to national aandc protocols."
"based on interviews with program officers and managers and our review of a selection of infrastructure project files, we found that slightly different philosophies had evolved in regions about the role of the department vis---vis infrastructure, and sometimes different philosophies existed within a region."

the regions visited all calculated funding levels for infrastructure operations and maintenance based on the number and types of infrastructure present in each community and in accordance with maintenance cost schedules.
"we expected to find risk-based practices that included greater focus on recipients who had a history of depleting their infrastructure assets at an accelerated pace when compared against depreciation benchmarks, with less focus on recipients who had a proven track record of maintaining their infrastructure assets."
we found no evidence of a risk-based approach to funding recipients or to monitoring recipient use of operations and maintenance funding.
the audit found that national protocols are being rolled out for the 2014-15 fiscal year to guide allocation decisions for pspp funding provided to institutions and that delivery of the student-focused programs has been left largely to the regions.
"this example reinforces the importance of a clear annual cycle for rolling out major program changes, carried out in a consistent manner with due time allotted for identifying and addressing implementation risks and challenges of regions, and recipients."
"the audit found that the student-focused psssp and ucepp programs are administered by first nations and tribal councils, with little in the way of national or regional program control frameworks."
"the hq education program has developed national protocols on student and expenditure eligibility; however, there are no national protocols or guidelines in place to guide regions in the risk-based monitoring of agreements, in providing support to first nations with administration of their programs, or in the management of surplus funds."
we also observed that regions perform no monitoring of post-secondary funding and there were no national guidelines for managing recipient surpluses.
a best practice was noted in one region visited whereby recipients who had not spent their full allocation in the prior year were required to submit proposals demonstrating that they had enough students to utilize their full allocation during the current fiscal year.
the absence of a national program control framework and more current guidelines for psssp and ucepp has led to regions devising their own approaches to program management and has led to inconsistency across regions.
"similar to infrastructure programming, we found that regional staff had evolved different philosophies on how post-secondary funding should be administered."
"some regional staff saw it as appropriate to continue funding at historical funding levels even though first nations regularly surplus funds, while others saw it as their duty to ensure that first nations spend their annual allocated post-secondary funding on post-secondary programming."
"the findings vis---vis regional implementation of the psssp and ucepp program control frameworks and the differing philosophies of regional staff reinforce the importance of national processes for allocating program funds, performing risk-based compliance reviews, supporting first nations with program administration and managing program surpluses, as well as national training and guidelines for regional staff administering these programs."
"based on information obtained from departmental officials, we understand that the number of data collection instruments collected by aandc has been reduced considerably for the three program areas in question as a result of a commitment by the government of canada to reduce recipient reporting burden."
"note, however, that some of the reports required in prior years were merged over the period in question, so the reduction in the number of reports may be higher than the reduction in data points being collected."
"at the time of our audit, two of these systems were in the process of implementing and debugging their data collection modules (eis and fncfs (ims)) and had not yet implemented advanced data analysis and reporting functionalities."
"based on our review of a sample of reports in each region and discussions with regional and hq program officials, we found that all systems are leading to marked improvements in the completeness and accuracy of data collected from recipients and entered into systems."
this focus on data completeness and accuracy has translated into an increased demand on many first nations who may not have been submitting complete or accurate reports in prior years.
"based on our review of documentation and discussions with region and hq program staff, we observed that program information systems included more focus on gathering performance information for hq programs and less focus on designing reporting for regional program delivery staff (e.g. there are few standard reports for program managers, program advisors and recipients, which are intended to support ongoing management of the program)."
we identified opportunities in all programs to leverage the information systems and recipient data to improve risk-based decisions regarding the various agreement management approaches.
"as another example, the post-secondary module of eis includes collection of transactional information that could be used to run automated scripts designed to identify potential anomalies (e.g. students funded from two sources, first nations communities with inconsistent per student funding levels, first nations who are not reporting sufficient transactional data to account for all of their funding, etc.)."
"the high frequency of reports that are cancelled and/or not received, coupled with our testing observations that regional personnel are not consistently using data from reports to make risk-based decisions, highlights the importance of re-evaluating whether the amount and type of information identified for collection is actually needed."
development and approval of program control frameworks the audit expected to find clear departmental processes and governance structures which support the design and approval of risk-based program control frameworks.
"further, we expected to find that: program control frameworks contain consistent elements from one program to the next; it would be clear what changes to program control frameworks require approval outside of the program sector; adequate support was made available to programs developing program control frameworks; appropriate challenge functions were in place to support approval, including from regions, the chief financial officer sector and the regional operations sector; recipients were being engaged in a timely manner, when possible and appropriate, to identify potential implementation challenges; a common look and feel was employed for program control frameworks to promote ease of use in regions; a single window approach to communicating program control frameworks to regions and recipients was in place to promote their adoption in regions; and all program control frameworks promoted risk-based regimes for reporting, monitoring and other aspects of agreement management."
the audit found a lack of consistency in the processes employed by programs to redesign program control frameworks coupled with a significant number of recent and ongoing program and system changes has resulted in unintended implementation challenges for most aandc regions and the few first nations administrators we interviewed.
"while the department has a management control framework for grants and contributions that includes requirements for the design and approval of programs, it does not establish clear roles, responsibilities, or protocols to govern the process."
"as a result, each program creates program control frameworks according to its own understanding of what a program control framework should be and consults and seeks approval in a manner that it deems appropriate."
"this said, it is not clear that director general level committees (e.g. directors general implementation and operations committee) or internal challenge functions have been sufficiently engaged in addressing implementation risks and challenges prior to recommending approval of program control frameworks to senior management committees."
"presently, the transfer payments centre of expertise (tpcoe) within cfo sector considers aspects of program control frameworks which relate to transfer payment policies and directives, but is not equipped to support and challenge the component parts of program control frameworks that lie outside these policies and directives, for example: developing and maintaining protocols on the elements to be included in program control frameworks; managing the process by which other functions in the department review and sign-off on program control frameworks prior to tabling at senior management committees for approval; establishing a common look and feel for program control frameworks; providing support and advice to programs that are developing new or amended program control frameworks, including assisting with the writing of documents; assuming a challenge role around the implementation of new recipient reporting requirements; managing the dissemination of new recipient reporting templates to regions to align implementation to an annual cycle; providing support and advice to programs on how to consult with regions and first nations when implementing major system changes; supporting timely consultation with regional staff and first nations to identify potential implementation challenges and risks; promoting sharing of best practices among regions and with hq programs that are developing new or amended program control frameworks; maintaining a portal through which program control frameworks are disseminated to regions and first nations; and, developing and maintaining competency-based learning regimes or frameworks (possibly using a development track) for certain regional roles (e.g. fsos, data entry clerks, compliance officers, community development or case management officers, etc.)."
this function could include a blend of existing expertise in program design and regional implementation with expertise in the development of risk-based program management regimes.
"in its 2006 report, the independent blue ribbon panel on grant and contribution programs highlighted the importance of establishing risk-based reporting requirements and management regimes."
"examples of insufficient control include: performing no monitoring or compliance testing of infrastructure operations and maintenance spending, even though some first nation communities have a history of infrastructure degrading at a rate that far exceeds a normal depreciation curve; performing no risk-based monitoring or audits of post-secondary education spending; and, regions performing little or no compliance monitoring on child and family services agencies, despite the program having developed a risk based compliance planner and a draft compliance review checklist."
we found that most of the data points in the dcis were not directly supporting performance indicators in the pmss.
"for two of the three programs included in the audit, infrastructure and education, we noted that most of the data collection strategies for measuring performance indicators in the program pmss called for obtaining data from alternate sources, many of which had not yet been defined."
we also found that none of the reporting regimes for the three programs examined employed a risk-based approach.
"all data was requested of all recipients, regardless of their history of meeting obligations under the agreement or their demonstrated capacity."
"we found that when programs neglect to delineate performance measurement reporting from program management and compliance reporting, it impedes the regions- ability to apply risk-based reporting regimes."
"this should include delineating information required for performance measurement from information being collected for possible compliance activities to allow for the application of risk-based reporting regimes (e.g. for projects, programs and recipients)."
"recommendation: the chief financial officer and the senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations, in collaboration with the assistant deputy minister, northern affairs organization and program assistant deputy ministers, should review key transfer payment management functions to promote greater consistency across regions, including regional organizational structures, classifications, capacity levels and role assignments. management action plan recommendations management response / actions responsible manager (title) planned implementation date note: the following is an update on the status of management-s responses/actions to address the recommendations contained in the audit of the management control framework for grants and contributions 2013-14 as at february 20, 2015. recommendation #1: since the last audit committee, there have been subsequent discussions among senior management on the issue of appropriate governance for the oversight of the department's grants and contributions (g&c), the first element of the first recommendation of the report."
this review will factor in the issue of effective oversight of g&c based on the approved principle.
"review other government department processes (such as hc, cida) with respect to the design/redesign, approval and implementation of program control frameworks that could be relevant to aandc."
this function could include a blend of existing expertise in program design and regional implementation with expertise in the development of risk-based program management regimes.
"the governance structure and framework will: create a cross-sectional departmental -community of practice- (as required), with appropriate management leadership for the purpose of providing program design and program management expertise for development and implementation of new and amended frameworks."
"this should include delineating information required for performance measurement from information being collected for possible compliance activities to allow for the application of risk-based reporting regimes (e.g. for projects, programs and recipients)."
"the oversight by the governance structure will include a risk based approach to reducing the reporting burden, and will be implemented in a phased approach commencing jan/feb 2015."

"departmental processes for the design of pcfs ensure that monitoring, reporting and compliance requirements reflect the risks specific to the program, its terms and conditions, the value of funding in relation to administrative costs, and the risk profile of recipients."
"departmental processes for the design of pcfs seek input from department stakeholders (e.g. those responsible for program delivery, and those who currently administer other departmental programs) to ensure that expected outcomes and appropriate policies and procedures, resources, systems and supporting tools are developed to facilitate consistency of program implementation and the achievement of objectives."
"departmental processes for the design of pcfs ensure that appropriate funding instruments are chosen to respect and achieve a balance between the principles of accountability, cost/benefit, risk management and treatment of program recipients."
criterion #2: departmental transfer payment governance processes and structures adequately support the approval of risk-based program control frameworks.
"governance processes, structures and delegated authorities for the approval of risk-based program control frameworks are clearly defined and understood."
"departmental policy and principles for the management of transfer payment programs, including implied risk tolerances are clear and consistently understood (e.g. by oversight bodies) in approving the various elements of pcfs."
"criterion #3: departmental processes for designing recipient reporting requirements are adequate to ensure that appropriate performance and financial information is gathered to support the department in fulfilling its stewardship and accountability obligations, giving due regard for the importance of reducing reporting burden on recipients."
departmental processes and authorities for the design and approval of recipient reporting requirements are clear and appropriate.
departmental processes for the design of recipient reporting requirements include consideration of input from regions to ensure that information requirements support risk-based decision making on how programs are managed and funding is allocated.
departmental processes ensure that programs employ a risk-informed approach to establishing the need for recipient reporting information as it relates to program compliance reporting and monitoring (degree/extent of reporting and frequency of reporting).
criterion #6: performance and accountability information collected from recipients is analyzed and used to support risk-based decision-making in establishing and managing the recipient relationship.
"information from recipient reporting is used by fsos and program officers to evaluate, on a risk-informed basis, recipient compliance with agreement obligations and minimum program requirements."
"information from recipient reporting is analyzed by fsos and program officers and is used to inform risk-based decision making with respect to the type of funding agreement to be entered into with the recipient, as well as the cash management provisions of the agreement and the nature and frequency of reporting."
"criterion #7: performance and accountability information collected from recipients is consolidated, analyzed and used to inform risk-based decisions on how programs are managed and funding is allocated."
"during the conduct of the audit, the internal audit team observed that the organizational and governance structures are established to oversee ohs activities at both a local level by way of the workplace ohs committee and the regional ohs coordinator and at a national level by way of the national ohs program policy committee and the national ohs program."
minutes of committee meetings and results of interviews indicate that local and national committee members demonstrate a high level of dedication in addressing ohs issues.
management responses are included and provide: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan.
monitoring the employment and social development canada hazard prevention program guide requires that the employer shall monitor the progress of the implementation of hazard prevention programs and that the evaluation of program effectiveness should be conducted at least every 3 years.
"in addition, the aafc ohs policy states that aafc will achieve a healthy and safe working environment through development, implementation and monitoring of an hazard prevention program encompassing the elements of a hazard identification process."
"employment and social development canada further requires that the methodology considers inputs and factors that include among others: hazardous occurrence reports, workplace inspection results, time lost due to injury and also requires the review and updating of the methodology on a regular basis."
"further, it is not used to guide the program development or national ohs program activities."
trend analysis at the local workplace level is informal with workplace ohs committees indirectly monitoring ohs primarily via workplace inspections and the review of hazardous occurrence incident reports.
"as well, regional ohs coordinators are generally in attendance at workplace ohs committee meetings or receive a copy of the meeting minutes."
"if a trend is identified, it may be verbally shared at the national level."
assessment of hazard prevention program implementation the national ohs program created a database in fall 2014 to capture workplace ohs committee information such as the ohs policies and programs that have been locally implemented.
the database was expected to be populated by all research centres as of march 2015.
national ohs program 5 year plan work activities are planned by the national ohs program for a 5 year period and are documented in the -5 year plan-.
internal audit reviewed the current version of the plan and observed that the current plan includes a more comprehensive review of policies than its previous version.
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: september 2016 implement a process to conduct regular assessment (at least every 3 years) of the implementation of the hazard prevention program at the local level (workplace ohs committee and health and safety committees)."
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb will establish a process for the review of the implementation of the hazard prevention program across agriculture and agri-food canada every 3 years."
the results of the assessment will be a standing item on the regional ohs coordinator meetings and presented quarterly at the national ohs policy committee.
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb agrees to create a 3 year hazard prevention program work plan that includes a cyclical review of all components of the hazard prevention program."
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: develop 3 year plan for review of hazard prevention program components by december 2015. update plan to include development of new directives, policies and guidelines by october 2016."
"internal audit reviewed whether aafc-s policies, guidelines and processes related to ohs are implemented, monitored, updated on a regular basis and aligns with relevant laws and regulations."
"in interviews with members of the national ohs program, the audit team was advised that the delay in development was due to the number of individuals involved in the review and approval of these directives."
"in an effort to determine whether the key directives released in early 2015 were compliant with the canada labour code - part ii regulations and general best practices, internal audit contracted a subject matter expert to review the documentation."
"following the review, the subject matter expert deemed that the directives are compliant with the canada labour code - part ii."
"internal audit determined that at a national level, there is no listing of the directives and/or programs that have been developed and are in place at local aafc workplaces."
this information would assist the national ohs program in planning and in the development of future directives by leveraging information that already exists.
"recommendation adm, cmb should review the development and approval process for national directives to ensure timely development."
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb will review the current process for the consultation and approval of national directives, programs and policies using the lean process methodology."
"the new process developed will allow for a more streamlined process with fewer steps than the current process, thereby ensuring the timely development of national ohs directives."
"the process review and development will include the creation of a working group including key stakeholders from cmb, stb and the national ohs policy committee."
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: october 2016 reporting to regulatory bodies in the event of hazardous occurrences in the workplace, employment and social development canada has established a process and timelines for documenting and reporting the details of the incident."
"all accidents, occupational diseases and other hazardous occurrences affecting any of the employer's workers must be investigated by a qualified person who must record the details of the incident on a hazardous occurrence incident report template."
reports are presented at the workplace ohs committee (and signed-off by committee co-chairs) to review the nature of the occurrence and identify whether mitigating measures are required.
"employment and social development canada has defined the type of incidences which require the hazardous occurrence incident report to be sent to employment and social development canada as follows: minor injury: any employment injury or an occupational disease for which medical treatment is provided and excludes a disabling injury [note: medical treatment is that which is provided at a medical treatment facility, which means at a hospital, medical clinic or physician's office at which emergency medical treatment can be dispensed and is not to be confused with first aid.] disabling injury: any employment injury or an occupational disease that results in either time loss, or modified duties."
"disabling injuries can be either temporary (e.g. sprained wrist), or permanent (e.g. severed limb), depending on whether or not the employee is expected to make a full recovery."
loss of consciousness: from an electric shock or a toxic or oxygen deficient atmosphere.
"rescue / revival or other emergency procedures: any incident that requires emergency procedures to be implemented, such as a hazardous substance spill, bomb threat or violence prevention procedure."
the hazardous occurrence incident report document is the first recording of occurrences and becomes the source of initial reporting to employment and social development canada.
it is also subsequently used in the annual workplace committee reporting to employment and social development canada that summarizes individual hazardous occurrence incident report information for both the workplace ohs committee and departmentally.
"once completed, hazardous occurrence incident reports are sent to employment and social development canada by the workplace ohs committee employer co-chair and are then sent to the regional osh coordinator who is responsible to enter the occurrence information from the hazardous occurrence incident report into a departmental database."
the audit team reviewed hazardous occurrence incident reports from september 2013 to december 2014 to determine the accuracy of reporting to the regulator and noted evidence of erroneous (either over and/or under) reporting of minor and/or disabling injuries to employment and social development canada.
interviews with national ohs program management noted that the local workplace committees made errors in reporting because they were unclear about the types of occurrences that required reporting to employment and social development canada.
the national ohs program management advised the audit team that they were aware of the reporting errors and had issued revised guidance to local workplace ohs committees in early 2015 to clarify how to complete the employment and social development canada forms.
the guidance communicated how to report hazardous occurrences and provided clarification of the types of occurrences that require reporting to employment and social development canada.
"to help ensure the consistent application, the guidance also requested that the annual workplace committee reporting (summary of individual occurrences for the year) be submitted and reviewed by the regional ohs coordinator prior to submission to employment and social development canada."
"by requesting that the annual workplace committee report be submitted and reviewed by the regional ohs coordinator prior to submission to employment and social development canada, the erroneous information has already been submitted to employment and social development canada by way of the hazardous occurrence incident report."
"as such, the regional ohs coordinator would only be reviewing the accuracy of numbers and of the information in the annual report against what has already been submitted to employment and social development canada and therefore could not influence the consistency of reporting."
"recommendation adm, cmb should review current reporting process to include a review of hazardous occurrence incident reports by the regional ohs coordinators prior to submission to employment and social development canada in an effort to improve consistency and accuracy of reporting across aafc."
management response: agree action plan: the national ohs program will update the current hazardous occurrence incident reports reporting process to ensure that all hazardous occurrence incident reports are sent to regional ohs coordinators for review prior to submission to employment and social development canada.
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: new process effective december 1, 2015 with documentation to be published january 2016. reporting employment and social development canada requires that following the assessment of the hazard prevention program, a formal report be prepared to document the results."
the director responsible for the national ohs program provided informal updates to the responsible dg who then updated the adm responsible for ohs.
"as a best practice, an annual report that provides senior management with updates on the number of occurrences, complaints observed during the year, the identification of any trends and the achievements of the national ohs program would provide useful information for monitoring the effectiveness of the program."
"recommendation adm, cmb should develop and present a report to aafc senior management that, as a minimum, documents the results of the assessment of hazard prevention program implementation, in compliance with employment and social development canada requirements."
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb will develop an ohs annual report that will be presented at directors general management committee and departmental management committee."
"this report will include incidents, training and implementation of hazard prevention program components."
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: june 2016 training employment and social development canada provides limited guidance regarding employee training and simply states that the employer shall provide health and safety education to each employee."
"as a part of the hazard prevention program developed at aafc, the national ohs program has established a set of mandatory training courses for occupational health and safety."
"training has been defined for students, employees, supervisors, executives, occupational health and safety committee members and temporary employees working at aafc for less than 6 months (including casuals, seasonal, terms less than 6 months, non-employees and student employees)."
"depending on the employee and their role, mandatory training may include multiple courses."
"as per the aafc ohs policy, supervisors are responsible to provide employees with the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary to ensure their health and safety."
"internal audit tested whether employees and non-employees are trained in a timely manner as per aafc mandatory requirements, at the time of the audit."
"aafc relies on the collaboration of volunteers, fellows and post-doctoral students who work directly with scientists on research projects at aafc research centres across the country."
"these individuals work at the research centres via natural sciences engineering research council agreements, volunteer agreements or research participation agreements and do not receive a salary or benefits from aafc."
"for ease of differentiation between paid aafc employees, the audit team has defined this group of individuals as non-employees."
"given that non-employees are granted access to work in aafc facilities, they should be provided with ohs training as noted above."
"employee training the audit team selected a sample of employees staffed in positions within aafc-s ohs organizational structure (i.e. regional coordinators, workplace committee members and employees working for the national program) as well as a random sample of employees located across the department."
"the team reviewed their training records (as of june 23, 2015) to determine whether aafc ohs mandatory training was taken."
"training was deemed to have been taken in a timely manner for the sample of employees tested, who had received training, with the exception of the aafc senior managers tested."
"non-employee training the canada labour code - part ii requirement notes that persons granted access to a facility be familiar with all prescribed safety materials, equipment, devices and clothing."
"in addition, the aafc ohs policy (april 2014) includes roles and responsibilities for aafc managers which state that the manager is responsible `to ensure that contractors and visitors comply with the persons granted access directive- and the policy noted that the directive would be developed shortly."
the current -5 year plan- for the national ohs program scheduled the implementation of the persons granted access directive by june 2015.
"given the large number of non-employees who access aafc facilities, internal audit selected 6 research centres to determine whether the mandatory ohs training course is provided to non-employees."
"the aafc research centre managers interviewed advised that they rely on the fact that these individuals received ohs training from either natural sciences and engineering research council or the university, therefore the managers deemed the aafc training to be duplicative."
"as such, this is non-compliant with aafc ohs policy and canada labour code - part ii requirements the audit team also reviewed the ohs training and awareness programs and supporting tools to determine whether they are established, delivered, monitored and updated to ensure the health and safety of work places."
"with the exception of training for temporary employees, the regional ohs coordinator facilitates the delivery of mandatory training modules in their region at the request of management."
training for temporary employees is provided by management or co-chairs of the workplace committee where the employee is located.
"recommendation adm, cmb should ensure that communication is delivered to all aafc managers on the requirements for providing ohs training to all individuals who are granted access to aafc facilities."
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb will target employee categories to communicate the required ohs specific training."
"this training will specifically target the executive community, non-employees and all persons granted access for work purposes such as visiting fellows, natural sciences engineering research council students and volunteers."
branch specific training data will be presented as part of the annual ohs report (as identified in recommendation #4) to advise branch heads of their specific rates of training completion.
"the national ohs program will promote awareness of required training by way of news@work, a targeted training blitz, executive orientation material as well as the implementation of a national practice for documenting training provided to non-employees."
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: june 2016 annex a: audit lines of enquiry oversight, roles, responsibilities and accountabilities an oversight structure is established and ohs roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities are clearly defined, communicated and implemented to ensure effective oversight and successful implementation of the ohs program."
"training, tools and awareness employees and non-employees are trained in support of legal requirements of ohs and in a timely manner."
"ohs training and awareness programs and supporting tools are established, delivered, monitored and updated to ensure the health and safety of workplaces."
"policies and programs aafc-s policies, guidelines and processes related to ohs are implemented, monitored, updated on a regular basis and align with relevant laws and regulations reporting and monitoring formal ohs reporting and monitoring mechanisms are established, implemented and accurate to ensure aafc-s ohs program is in compliance with legal requirements."
internal audit observed that key oversight documents are established and align with canada labour code requirements.
"the section below presents the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provides recommendations for improvement."
hazard identification and risk assessment employment and social development canada requires that employers develop a hazard prevention program based on a documented methodology for hazard identification and risk assessment.
a hazard risk registry document was developed in 2007 outlining the risks associated with aafc business activities.
"however, the risk registry has not been updated and interviews indicated that the document was developed using subjective methodology without a documented process."
"as such, the national ohs policy committee did not receive accurate information required to identify, assess, respond to and monitor ohs risk at local level."
the national ohs program does not conduct formal trend analysis to guide national program development and feed into the work plan of the national ohs program.
"without a documented methodology for hazard identification and risk assessment process, there is the potential risk that the hazard prevention program will not focus on the areas of highest risk."
the national ohs program management selected research centres at highest risk to first populate the database.
"as well, the national ohs program management did not plan to extend the request beyond the high risk locations."
"while the database does not currently address the regulatory requirements for the assessment of hazard prevention program implementation, a well maintained and monitored database has the potential to provide national ohs program management with the information necessary to assess policy and program implementation at the local levels on an ongoing basis."
"at the time of the audit, aside from the database noted above, the national ohs program did not have a mechanism in place to assess and monitor implementation of the hazard prevention program across aafc to meet the requirements of employment and social development canada and aafc."
"however, the review is planned 4 to 5 years from the last review as opposed to the 3 year requirement established by employment and social development canada."
"the audit team also noted that the current -5 year plan- did not include review of all the policies, directives and programs in the established hazard prevention program."
at the time of the audit the -5 year plan- was not disseminated to local workplace ohs committees to communicate the activities of the national ohs program and to reduce the likelihood of a duplication of effort by the workplace committees.
"recommendation in order to comply with employment and social development canada labour program guidelines, the adm, cmb should: develop a methodology for hazard identification and risk assessment."
"management response: agree action plan: the adm, cmb will develop and document a methodology used for analysis and assessment of all identified hazards and risks."
the methodology will include identifying both known and foreseeable hazards and will be based on a health and safety risk identification and management methodology.
"lead(s) responsible: director, workplace wellness programs target date for completion: january 2016 establish a plan for the national ohs program that includes the review of existing components of the hazard prevention program such as directives/guidelines every 3 years and includes the development of new directives and guidance based on the hazard identification and risk assessment process."
"following the implementation of recommendation 1a, this 3 year plan will also include the development of new directives, policies and guidelines based on the analysis and risk assessment identified in section 1a."
"policies and programs employment and social development canada requires that workplace hazard prevention programs include preventative measures such as policies, directives, guidelines and processes based on hazards identified within the workplace."
"the audit team noted that the department has a comprehensive set of policies, directives and program instruments to guide ohs management at aafc."
"as noted above in the monitoring section (section 2.1), there is no hazard identification process or risk assessment in place to determine or assess whether polices and program developed and implemented are appropriate."
interviews stated that policies are developed on a reactive basis and are not based on risk.
internal audit also reviewed whether directives were developed by the national ohs program in a timely manner and observed a lack of timely development (more than one year) of key directives released during the conduct of the audit.
workplace ohs committee members interviewed across the department commented that there has been a lack of communication of national ohs program activities on the development of national directives.
"occurrences that do not require medical treatment do not need to be individually reported to employment and social development canada, however, the fact that an investigation was conducted is required to be reported to employment and social development canada through the annual workplace committee report."
accurate reporting to the regulator is important to ensure that mitigating measures are implemented in areas of highest risk.
"based on the above, it is the opinion of the audit team that the control weakness for the reporting errors has yet to be adequately mitigated and that the regional ohs coordinator should review the hazardous occurrence incident report prior to it being sent to employment and social development canada to ensure consistency with the national ohs program guidance."
"at the time of the audit, the national ohs program did not report to an aafc senior management committee to provide updates on the implementation of the hazard prevention program and national ohs program activities and achievements."
report will be based on a calendar year to align with employment and social development canada reporting.
"as a result of this testing, internal audit observed that training had been taken by the regional coordinators and employees working for the national program and a lack of training being taken by key employee groups such as workplace ohs committee members and executives within the department."
internal audit confirmed with the national ohs program that the directive is now planned to be developed on a longer term horizon with no specific date established (see recommendation 3 in the monitoring section 2.1).
interviews with research centre management noted that ohs training is provided when individuals start at the centre and they are not allowed to begin working until they receive their ohs training.
"however, internal audit determined that for 3 out of the 6 centres selected, the aafc mandatory ohs training was not provided to natural sciences and engineering research council students or individuals working in the research centres under research participation agreements."
"based on interviews, internal audit determined that the national training program was established in 2007 based on training material that was already in place at the kentville research centre."
interviewees at national ohs program understood that the material was developed based on information and training modules from employment and social development canada.
"the training material has not been updated since it was implemented, however, the content was being reviewed by the national ohs program at the time of the audit."
internal audit observed that the monitoring of training is conducted both at the local and national level.
"that being said, the internal audit team found that the data found in the departmental software and used by the national ohs program to monitor training is an unreliable source of data as training information is inconsistently being entered into the system."
"without consistent delivery of training to all employees and non-employees, there is an increased risk of injury in the workplace."
"roles, responsibilities and procedures for effective decision making we expected ssc to have documented and communicated the roles and responsibilities for effective decision making as found in the treasury board of canada secretariat management accountability framework (maf)."
the executive committee tors were available to employees via ssc-s extranet.
tors were approved by either the delegating committee or the committee itself.
there was also no clear expectation as to how changes to the tors were to be approved.
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure that committee terms of reference (tor) are approved by the decision-making authority delegating the authority to the committee and that the tors include dates and versioning information."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be circulated by the executive committees group periodically to committee chairs for review by each committee and then to the president of ssc for final approval.
"the pgof required the involvement of the smb, sppoc and btc as part of its documented approval process."
"recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure consistency with the decision-making authorities stated in ssc-s project governance framework."
decision-making process we expected to find a documented decision-making process for decisions made in the committees.
"none of the executive committees- tors stated whether decisions were by majority vote, consensus or decisions were to be made by the committee chair alone."
not having a documented and communicated decision-making process could lead to confusion and unclear committee accountability.
only the smb documented what constituted a quorum for holding a meeting and the dvmc documented the requirements for a quorum for decision making.
"recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should establish and document decision-making processes for each of the executive committees, including quorum."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be updated to include the decision-making process as well as the accountability reporting structure. quorum will also be specified.
decision-making tools we expected that tools would be in place to support effective committee decision making.
"for example, the average attendance for each committee reviewed was as follows: smb 90%; cmc 75%; sppoc 95%; btc 76%; oc 68%; and osrc 85%."
we also found that items were not accurately categorized in the agendas.
"for example, nine of 25 agenda items were identified as being -for information- or -for discussion-, but resulted in documented decisions being made."
"if item owners were unclear about the purpose of their presentation in the agenda, it could result in committee members being unprepared for the meeting and create inconsistencies in overall committee record keeping."
"recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services and chief financial officer should ensure that action items issued by the committees are properly documented and tracked."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation.
"since september 2014, the executive committees group has established processes and tools to support the ability to document and track executive committee business decisions."
departmental vacancy management committee we expected the dvmc to function as stipulated in its tor.
two of the dvmc-s strategic objectives were to -ensure transformation initiatives and projects (from planning to execution) are resourced in an effective and timely manner- and to -ensure that business continuity and service to canadians is maintained-.
"staffing actions were being put on hold, which created operational difficulties that directly affected the organization."
only 65 of 111 (59%) of the reviewed items were found on the dvmc rods.
some of the remaining items were scheduled to appear at committee meetings but were approved secretarially due to meeting cancellations.
a majority of staffing items (106 of 111) were in line with the requirements set out in the tors.
"there were control weaknesses noted as staffing items were accepted and approved without all of the required information, such as the verification of gateway to mobility or the approval of the senior assistant deputy minister."
dvmc-s tors stated that all voting members must be present for quorum to be established.
"during those meetings, 24 staffing items were presented and 20 were approved despite not having met the requirements for quorum."
management response: the chair of the dvmc agrees with the findings of the audit.
"ssc is reviewing its governance as part of its way forward, and will be replacing the current dvmc with an approach that integrates workplace management into its formal governance structure and ensures that staffing activity is planned, approved and regularly monitored."
"these committees noted the need for more information, clarification or granted conditional approvals due to the insufficiency of the information."
the executive committee directives stated that documentation for internal executive committees was required to be submitted 48 hours in advance of the meetings.
interviewees were generally satisfied with the timeliness of information provided.
monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of ssc-s governance structure we expected ssc-s governance structure to be monitored in a regular and timely manner to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness in accordance with the policy and programs and governance and strategic elements of the maf.
"during the audit, ssc-s corporate secretariat was performing two reviews to assess the efficiency of ssc-s governance structure."
"the first was a quarterly review process, which looked at the functioning of the senior committees."
it was expected that the frequency of this review would be reduced to bi-annually.
the second review process was at the adm- and dg-level committees and working groups review.
"through that process, 58 different committees with membership at the dg-level or above had been identified and preliminary inventories of those committees had been taken."
the review was still underway at the completion of the audit work.
"the efficiency of ssc-s committees was also addressed by the executive committee directives, which issued guidance on topics such as length of presentation decks, when materials should be submitted to committees, security measures and avoiding meeting disruptions (e.g. limiting the use of handheld devices)."
the adm- and dg-level review was looking to examine issues related to the effectiveness of the governance structure (e.g. examining the linkages between the committees and mapping out how items move through the governance process).
we were advised that executive committees were monitoring their own effectiveness through the committee chairs.
"conclusion the objective of this audit was to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of ssc-s corporate governance (structure, processes, controls and information for decision making) with a view to supporting efficiency, accountability and achievement of ssc-s mandate."
all executive committees included in this audit had documented and communicated their roles and responsibilities in their respective tors.
"the committees were able to mitigate any concerns by requesting additional information, clarifications, or issuing conditional approvals."
the efficiency of the governance structure was monitored on a regular basis by the corporate secretary-s quarterly review process.
an adm- and dg-level committees and working groups review was also taking place to assess the effectiveness of the governance structure.
these mechanisms were supplemented by committee self-monitoring.
management response and action plans overall management response management has reviewed the summary of findings on the audit of ssc-s governance framework and agrees with the findings of the audit and the recommendations.
ssc agrees that the executive committee tors must be consistently reviewed and approved.
final versions must be available to stakeholders to ensure that they are fulfilling their roles as expected.
ssc also agrees that it is important to monitor and track action items resulting from committee meetings.
"in addition, ssc is reviewing its governance as part of its way forward, and will be replacing the current dvmc with an approach that integrates workplace management into its formal governance structure and ensures that staffing activity is planned, approved and regularly monitored."
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure that committee terms of reference (tor) are approved by the decision-making authority delegating the authority to the committee and that the tors include dates and versioning information."
"management action plan position responsible completion date tors for internal executive committees will be circulated by the executive committees group periodically to committee chairs for review by each committee, to incorporate any required changes."
revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
they will be dated and clearly identified as final versions.
draft versions will also be dated and clearly identified as such.
"changes to the organizational structure, as of april 1, 2015, will also be incorporated into the revised tors for internal executive committees."
the tors review and approval process will be incorporated into the executive committee directives document.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure consistency with the decision-making authorities stated in ssc-s project governance framework (pgof)."
tors will then be circulated by the executive committees group to committee chairs for review by each committee. revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should establish and document decision-making processes for each of the executive committees, including quorum."
management action plan position responsible completion date terms of reference (tor) for internal executive committees will be updated to include the decision-making process as well as the accountability reporting structure. quorum will also be specified.
tors will then be circulated by the executive committees group to committee chairs for review by each committee. revised tors will then be submitted to the president of ssc for final approval.
"director general, cs june 30, 2015 recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services (cs) and chief financial officer should ensure that action items issued by the committees are properly documented and tracked."
"management action plan position responsible completion date since september 2014, the executive committees group has established processes and tools to support the ability to document and track executive committee business decisions."
"more specifically, action trackers are used to register action items that have been agreed upon and captured in the record of decisions by respective committees."
"follow-up presentations, along with their respective leads, are then scheduled and tracked through the executive committee integrated forward agenda, which is sent to all management at the assistant deputy minister level on a weekly basis."
"in conjunction with project leads, the executive committees group documents and tracks the movement of action items and their return to committee for presentation until close-out."
management action plan position responsible completion date the dvmc will be replaced with the implementation of human resources plans for each branch that will proactively identify human resources priorities and requirements.
"once approved through formal governance, these plans will serve as the authority to proceed with staffing."
"plans will be regularly monitored by the corporate management board, and a dashboard to monitor performance and workforce growth will be developed for this purpose."
"director general, human resources and workplace september 30, 2015 annex a: audit criteria the following audit criteria were used in the conduct of this audit: ssc established roles, responsibilities and procedures for effective decision making."
ssc-s governance structure was monitored in a regular and timely manner to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.
we found that all executive and dg-level committees included in this audit had documented and communicated their roles and responsibilities in their respective tor.
"we found the approval of tors was inconsistent, both in who approved them and how they were documented."
we also noted that tors were neither dated nor had version tracking.
"as a result, it could be unclear to stakeholders as to whether the up-to-date tors were being consulted which could impact employees who were using them in their work."
the tors for these committees did not contain these responsibilities which may lead to inadequate or inappropriate decision making.
"management response: management agrees with the recommendation. tors for internal executive committees will be updated to include the gate approval requirements for each project complexity and risk assessment level, as stated in version 2.0 of ssc-s pgof, dated may 2014."
"however, we found no documented decision-making process for the executive committees."
"although the srb did not have a documented decision-making process, the tors stipulated who must be in attendance for key presentations."
we expected to find that decisions made were at the appropriate committee and within the committee-s mandate.
"we found that all decisions we reviewed were made at the appropriate committee, were within the committees- mandate and were recorded in the meetings- rod. we reviewed a list of items sent directly to the former president of ssc and the chief operating officer for decision to determine if they were following the appropriate approval processes and concluded that they did follow the expected governance structure."
"we found the committees used meeting agendas, corresponding rods and action trackers as their primary tools."
"however, we found several issues regarding attendance, agenda management and action tracking."
we found that meeting attendance varied between committees.
"however, this did not impact the meeting frequency as replacements were sent in most instances."
we found this to not be a significant issue and management has been advised.
"from our sample of agenda items, we found that not all items were recorded in the committee-s action tracker, and only one item was marked as completed during the scope of the audit."
"throughout the scope of the audit, we found that the dvmc did not address its strategic objectives, it had incomplete record keeping and it did not meet as required."
we generated a list of 111 staffing actions based on the dvmc-s staffing action information repository (entitled -dvmc master list-).
we also found that the dvmc master list did not always accurately reflect the information provided on the dvmc approval request form.
"as quorum was not established, these approvals should not have been given."
recommendation 5 the chair of the departmental vacancy management committee should ensure that: meetings take place in accordance with the terms of reference; proposed staffing actions meet all requirements prior to being tabled at a meeting; and decisions are appropriately recorded.
"information provided to the oversight bodies we expected that the information provided to ssc senior level committees would be sufficient, accurate and timely."
"from our review of the rods, we found all but one committee had indicated issues with the sufficiency of information."
"we found no concerns from committee members regarding the accuracy of information presented at the smb, cmc, sppoc, btc and osrc."
there was no documented decision-making process for how decisions were made in the committees.
"however, we found that all decisions reviewed were made at the appropriate committee, were within the committees- mandate and were recorded in the meetings- rod. based on our review, we concluded that there did not appear to be a risk of items circumventing the formal governance structure."
"we found some tools in place to support effective decision making, such as the creation of meeting agendas, corresponding rods and action trackers."
"however, there were issues regarding attendance, agenda management and action tracking."
we found that the dvmc was not functioning as intended.
"there were issues identified with frequent meeting cancelations, the lack of strategic direction setting and record keeping."
"information provided to the senior committees was generally sufficient, accurate and timely."
"management action plan position responsible completion date terms of reference (tor) for internal executive committees will be updated to include the gate approval requirements for each project complexity and risk assessment level, as stated in version 2.0 of the ssc pgof, dated may 2014."
"each action item-s relevant business information, including committee lead and project manager as well as expected completion dates, is documented in the action tracker by the executive committees group and confirmed by each executive committee-s chair."
"director general, cs completed recommendation 5 the chair of the departmental vacancy management committee (dvmc) should ensure that: meetings take place in accordance with the terms of reference; proposed staffing actions meet all requirements prior to being tabled at a meeting; and decisions are appropriately recorded."
"information provided to oversight bodies was sufficient, timely and accurate."
delivery of department-s mandate the audit team concluded that the staff rotation and mobility assignment system is designed and operating in a manner that allows for the flexible and timely assignment of employees to meet departmental operational priorities in canada and abroad.
the current system contains certain characteristics that facilitate the placement of employees.
"for example, rotation and mobility are conditions of employment; and acting appointments are excluded from merit and recourse requirements, all contributing to flexibility and timeliness of the process."
the flexibility and timeliness of the rotation and mobility system allow a large number of employees to rotate during the summer and fall posting seasons.
"for example, the 2014 posting season resulted in approximately 540 assignments abroad and 470 at headquarters."
"an additional 204 employees within headquarters were assigned to the special assignment pool, foreign language training or new recruit positions where new employees are trained."
the department-s flexibility has been enhanced by recent decisions to expand rotation and mobility to more employees.
"in fact, all executive positions have become rotational except those where there is a justified need for specialisation (e.g. trade policy or human resources and finance with professional designations)."
"as well, the department fully extended the option of mobility to employees from the economics and social sciences services (ec), commerce (co) and included the programme administration (pm) community, so as to reduce barriers among groups and to increase flexibility for managers in assigning staff."
"departmental strategic objectives the audit team expected to find policies, procedures or other instrument specific for the management of rotational and mobile assignments that would provide the department with an opportunity to articulate its objectives pursued through assignments, the key principles supporting assignment decisions and the expected outcomes from the assignment system."
these elements would provide management with guidance towards the effective management of the rotational and mobile assignment system.
"the auditors concluded that the department needs to more strongly communicate its strategic objectives and key principles supporting assignment decisions. while, the auditors have found governance documents that describe strategic objectives, they have not found evidence that those objectives are regularly communicated in a transparent way to staff."
"the rotational and mobile assignment system and processes are mostly communicated to managers and employees through two policy guidelines: the former department of foreign affairs and international trade-s guidelines on appointing to rotational positions, which describe the process by which employees are -appointed- to rotational or mobile positions."
the departmental assignment guidelines which are instructions for employees on how to apply for assignments.
they are written for each of the two annual assignment cycles for positions in canada and abroad (rotation and mobile).
they also communicate some conditions supporting assignment decisions.
"for example, the auditors are of the opinion that the assignment process would benefit from clear statements regarding the objective of placing the right person in the right position at the right time and the principle that departmental business needs should be primarily considered in the assignment decision making process."
the department needs to reinforce the importance of these strategic objectives and key principles to all managers as key considerations when making assignment decisions.
"a formal communication of these objective and principles through a policy instrument for example, would help to ensure their mandatory consideration in assignments decision making."
"recommendation 1: the assistant deputy minister, human resources branch should ensure that strategic objectives and key principles driving rotational and mobile assignment are clearly and consistently communicated to managers and employees to ensure assignment decisions are aligned with expected outcomes of the department."
"governance and oversight since rotational and mobile workforce has unique characteristics, the audit team expected to find a departmental governance structure playing an active oversight role to ensure departmental priorities are well served by the assignment process."
it was also expected that the department would have performance indicators and a data collection strategy to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the rotation and mobility system that includes regular reporting to senior management.
the audit team was informed that the operational level oversight role is provided by the assignment advisory committee (aac).
"through interviews with its members, the audit team was informed that the aac-s role is to provide advice on, and to recommend assignments to rotational and mobile positions in canada and abroad to the director general, assignment and pool management, who has the delegated authority for assignments."
"from a performance indicators perspective, the audit concluded that there is work to be done to develop and implement consistent performance measures that would inform the degree to which the staff rotation and mobility system is meeting the operational needs of the department."
"in particular, performance measures aligned with the objective of -placing the right person in the right position at the right time- would allow for reporting to senior management about the effectiveness of the system."
"recommendation 2: the assistant deputy minister, human resources branch should clarify the assignment advisory committee-s oversight role, including its reporting requirements to senior management, and ensure the committee plays that role effectively."
"recommendation 3: the assistant deputy minister, human resources branch should establish and implement a reporting system for the management of the rotation and mobility assignment process so that senior management is apprised of the ability and effectiveness of the rotation and mobility assignment system to meet the operational and strategic needs of the department."
human resources planning the audit team expected to find a department-wide human resources plan for the rotational and mobile workforce aligned with the department-s mandate and strategic and operational needs.
"human resources projections starting in november 2014, the assignment and pool management division began to complete rotational and mobile human resources projections, with the goal of maintaining the existing size and make-up of the various pools by occupational group and level."
these projections were planned to be updated quarterly and used when seeking approval of hiring and promotion exercises.
this is a first step to establishing a forecasting tool.
"first, they only identify the occupational groups and levels that are forecast as being required to fill existing positions; they do not detail other current and future departmental competency requirements (within canada and abroad) such as foreign language and mission specific knowledge, skills and abilities."
"second, the forecasts do not explicitly consider the changing business needs of the department (e.g. new trade agreements and increased emphasis in certain geographic regions or specific countries) and their impact on the make-up of the rotational and mobile pools."
"documentation of employees- knowledge, skills, abilities and competencies in order to effectively match employees with positions for which they are best suited, the audit team expected to find that the department has a means of collecting and applying the knowledge, skills, abilities and competencies of employees against the corresponding attributes and requirements of the available positions."
the audit team reviewed all posted assignments for the ex and fs categories for the 2014 and 2015 headquarters assignment cycles to determine whether associated position profiles were available and published.
none of the ex positions in 2014 or 2015 had an associated position profile.
"of the fs positions reviewed for 2014, the majority had a position profile."
"in 2015, all fs positions reviewed had an associated, improved position profile."
this improvement is attributed to the mandatory requirement that the assignment and pool management division placed on all managers to provide a position profile for the 2015 assignment cycle.
"building on this improvement, next steps will consist of documenting employees- knowledge, experience, skills and competencies, and matching them with position profile."
"since information is not held in a standardized, searchable database, the assignment divisions do not have a means of obtaining and maintaining information regarding available resources, in terms of skills, abilities and competencies."
"the assignment and pool management division informed the audit team that the department will soon move towards a competency-based system, which, in their opinion, will more clearly identify the requirements of each position and support a better matching of skills and job requirements."
"recommendation 4: the assistant deputy minister, human resources branch should: develop a process demonstrating that employees- knowledge, competencies, skills and experience are compared against and match the operational requirements of positions open for assignment; and include in the hr planning process department-s current and future operational needs for rotational and mobile employees."
"the audit team expected to find assignment files that documented important aspects of the assignment process, from the advertising of positions, to receipt of applications, to determination of assignment recommendations and the ultimate assignment decisions."
any solution should take into consideration cost and time requirements.
"recommendation 5: the assistant deputy minister, human resources branch should ensure that all rotational and mobile assignments are well documented including a rationale to tie employee knowledge, skills, abilities and competencies with position requirements."
the assignment process- fairness and transparency one of the audit criteria was that the rotational and mobile assignments process respects the public sector values of fairness and transparency.
the auditors determined that the process has elements that contribute to the demonstration of its fairness and transparency.
"first, the criteria for employee eligibility and the order of consideration are documented and well communicated in the guidelines for rotational and mobile assignments."
"second, the communication of assignment opportunities, recruitment and promotional exercises are done in a manner that is open and timely."
"third, the department offers information sessions, provides documents to address frequently asked questions and answers (faqs), and webinars to provide all employees with equal opportunities to raise questions and to be considered for assignments."
"in this regard, considering the process is unique and it involves a significant number of staff, the audit team is of the opinion that, the department should improve its documentation practices to enhance the transparency of the process (please see section 2.5 above)."
"furthermore, the auditors also consider that continuing the implementation of the competency-based approach in the assignment process as well as implementing the recommendations made in this report, would move towards addressing concerns with regard to fairness and transparency."
conclusion the management of staff rotation and mobility is designed and operating in a manner that allows the flexible and timely assignment of employees to meet departmental operational priorities in canada and abroad.
"they include: stronger and formal communication of strategic objectives pursued by the department through the assignment system and key principles guiding assignment decision making; ensuring oversight responsibilities over the rotation and mobility management framework are fulfilled; implementing a reporting system for the management of the rotation and mobility assignment process; improving of human resources planning; developing a system that supports alignment of departmental operational needs with rotational and mobile staff knowledge, skills, competencies and experience; and improving documentation of the rotational and mobile assignment processes."
"appendix a: about the audit audit objective the objective of this audit was to provide assurance that the management of staff rotation and mobility is effective, efficient and aligned with public sector values."
"audit scope this audit included: rotation and mobility systems that were in place in the former canadian international development agency and the former department of foreign affairs and international trade, and integration initiatives undertaken in the amalgamated department of foreign affairs, trade and development; human resources and financial transactions related to staff rotation and mobility during fiscal years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 completed prior to january 31, 2015."
there is an adequate governance structure in place to provide oversight and monitoring for the management of rotation and mobility.
the assignment process is designed to optimize the use of resources and is supported by adequate capacity and tools.
integrated financial and human resources planning is in place and sound stewardship is exercised over rotational and mobile budgets.
rotational and mobile assignments respect the public sector values of fairness and transparency.
the conduct phase of the audit was completed from january to april 2015.
the audit team found that the assignment guidelines provide important information to managers and employees regarding the assignment process.
"for example, the guidelines for assignment in canada states that: -mobility and rotation are conditions of employment; while employee preferences are a key consideration, an assignment may be made which is not among an applicant-s preferences.- however, the guidelines do not communicate important elements that would guide assignment management, such as departmental objectives that are pursued through the assignment system, the key principles supporting assignment decisions and expected outcomes from the assignment system."
"based on the examination of terms of reference, meeting minutes and interviews, the audit team determined that different senior management committees (corporate management committee, executive board and dm4) provide strategic direction and are involved in numerous key decisions with regard to staff rotation and mobility."
"however, auditors did not find any documentary evidence of the aac-s oversight mandate and responsibilities."
"the audit team was also advised that the committee-s mandate was informally expanded to that of providing advice with regard to rotation and mobile staff issues that might arise prior to presentation of options for deputy minister-s or executive board-s decisions. while the aac is involved in the operational decision making process related to assignments, it does not have a formal oversight mandate."
"at the time of the audit examination, performance measures and related data collection were challenging because there was no means to support and track assignment decisions and results over time."
"it should be noted, however, that there are some limitations to these projections."
the audit found that there was no history of an organized system of documentation to effectively match employees and positions.
"however, in 2014, the department took steps to systematically document rotational assignment position profiles, which constitutes a useful tool for employees to be informed of position requirements as well as the desired experience and background."
"for the current selection process, employees- experience and competencies are provided as part of their individual curriculum vitae but they are not collected and maintained by the assignment and pool management division beyond the current assignment process."
"documentation of assignment process and decisions in order to demonstrate that assignment decisions are appropriate, it was expected that a staff rotation and mobility assignment record keeping system exists and that it is structured, with complete information."
the audit team examined a variety of documents from three information repositories and concluded that there is a lack of a formal structure and consistent recording of information.
"while too much structure can impede the effectiveness of assignments operations (i.e. increased workload), sufficient structured documentation is needed to allow those responsible to provide senior management with the assurance that departmental operational requirements are consistently and appropriately considered in assignment decisions."
"notwithstanding, the audit team was informed by senior management within the human resources branch, former heads of mission, and by hiring managers of concerns that some staff may not perceive the assignment process as fair and transparent."
"however, the audit has identified areas for improvements in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the rotation and mobility system."
the audit scope did not include the heads of mission selection process.
audit criteria the following criteria were developed for this audit based on the risks identified in the planning phase and a review of the core management controls developed by the office of the comptroller general of canada the department has a rotation and mobility system that supports the alignment of skills sets and operational requirements.
"approach and methodology the auditors completed the audit using the following audit methodologies: process control mapping and analysis to identify key controls, assess their effectiveness and highlight any potential efficiencies or gaps; data analysis (human resources and finance) to determine trends, outliers and potential risk areas; root-cause analysis to determine reasons for non-compliance, misinterpretation or inconsistency - if found in testing; interviews with departmental executives, hiring managers, finance and human resource specialists to gain an understanding of key risks and opportunities; document review and analysis to assess sufficiency of information and guidance; and interviews to confirm process charts, documentation and the rotational and mobile assignment system."
the audit has resulted in a positive assurance.
"as described below, framework design needs improvement and information for decision making and compliance are assessed as adequate."
"as noted in the table, the first recommendation, when implemented, will positively impact all three lines of enquiry."
management-s response and action plan to address these recommendations is included in appendix c of this report.
line of enquiry assessment associated recommendation(s) framework design needs improvement information for decision making adequate compliance adequate overall audit conclusion adequate legend: potential audit ratings strong strong adequate adequate needs improvement needs improvement management attention required management attention required target performance target performance nrc-s revenue management framework design the audit examined nrc-s revenue management framework and the degree to which it was designed to ensure successful execution of nrc-s strategy.
nrc has developed and implemented a revenue focused strategy supported by a revenue management framework.
management of clients at the critical checkpoints in the framework is understood and client information is shared and used.
"for example, the establishment of sequentially numbered contracts should be considered so fb can ensure they are aware of all contracts being entered into."
"additionally, different systems owners results in information not being integrated across the revenue management framework."
changes to projects are the responsibility of the project manager and there is not a standardized approach to notifying bms when changes occur.
"bms is seeking to be more involved when change orders occur to ensure prompt ratification of the statement of work and subsequently, the contract."
ensuring that projects are maintained in sap ps would help ensure key project information is shared across the organization.
"as no formalized change order procedure exists to address contract amendments, there is an opportunity to design and implement a standardized process to encourage the sharing of information between the project manager, fb, and bms."
it is understood that this can be a result of the size and complexity of the associated portfolios.
"similarly, project management training and guidance varies at the portfolio level with some operating groups exhibiting robust and well-defined processes."
an example of this would be the use of costing templates.
a component of the planning phase of a project is the estimation of resourcing required to execute the contract.
this estimation generally makes use of costing templates that are developed by fb and posted on nrc-s intranet.
these templates are used throughout the portfolios but to a varying degree.
"as a result, nrc is missing an opportunity to reinforce the responsibilities project managers have to ensure a consistent approach to project planning and costing."
nrc is developing a standard revenue management process as part of a corporate services transformation initiative.
it will need all stakeholders to be involved if it is to be successfully implemented.
"it is recognized that due to differences in portfolio size, the organization cannot move to one standard approach but the adoption of common steps would be beneficial in the recording and management of critical information throughout the revenue management framework."
recommendation 1: finance branch should develop a holistic approach to revenue management that: involves all parties in development and implementation and; organizes key documentation in central repository while restricting access to business confidential information.
recommendation 2: planning and reporting services should develop a formal project change order process.
supporting information for decision making the audit examined whether the information required to make informed decisions was readily available corporately.
this finding was reinforced during the contract reviews carried out as part of the audit.
"the remaining 15% (3/19) of sampled projects exceeded their expected completion date and were noted by their project manager or other as being fully complete as of fy2015 year-end, effectively accruing all revenues due from the agreement."
one of the projects due for closing continued to have direct expenses applied to the project indicating that work was still ongoing.
"the remaining two projects saw negligible activity in the past 2 months which indicates, along with the project status provided by the project manager that the projects were unmaintained and should be closed."
"the use of nboss has been improving across the organization as noted during interviews with bms staff, who have plans to continue to monitor the use of the system going forward."
some stakeholders view the system as a client management tool to store information about contact with clients and potential sales whereas others see it as a revenue forecasting tool.
"this can lead to different expectations regarding the information to be entered and results in information varying between nboss the crm, and sap the accounting system."
"specifically, nboss contains potential revenue no matter how likely it is to being contracted versus the accounting system, sap, which consists of signed agreements forming contractual obligations."
"on a positive note, the opportunity to link sap sd and sap ps identified in the audit of financial management control framework - revenue has been implemented with contracts being tied directly to their respective projects."
no recommendation required compliance with government of canada and nrc policies and directives the audit examined whether current revenue management practices are aligned with government of canada and nrc policies and directives.
the audit assessed that these practices are being performed adequately. nrc has developed and successfully implemented standard templates for costing and contracting.
"minor alterations of general clauses were observed because nrc-s contracting-in policy allows for changes in language due to clarifications, or alterations which clearly benefit nrc, or the removal of irrelevant clauses."
one of the ten sampled contracts made use of legacy agreement templates which are in the process of being replaced by bms.
"during a review of the sampled contracts, one legacy agreement out of ten sampled contracts was found to be renewed without a renegotiation of pricing or calculating the level of effort required to execute the contract using updated labour rates."
"in addition, 91% of reviewed contracts were signed in compliance with the delegations of financial signing authority as they relate to contracting-in."
the rights to sign exclusive-use technology licenses are reserved for vice-presidents or the president.
nrc has defined a cost-plus pricing approach to ensure that projects recover their direct costs.
it is understood that some projects are entered into for investment purposes with the aim of generating revenue downstream for the government of canada and therefore are partially funded with in-kind contribution from nrc.
currently guidance on how to account for nrc in-kind contributions at the project level is undefined with most parties unsure of the role it plays in reporting.
forty three percent (3/7) of the sampled transactions marked by their project manager as being fully complete incurred costs that exceeded their revenues.
this was reinforced during the review of contracts which identified that costing information is not consistently being developed using the available tools.
seventy eighty percent of sampled transactions had accompanying costing documentation where the approved external labour billing rates were used along with the minimum mark-up on cost.
"in some cases, the projects examined were solely purposed to execute the sampled agreement."
the practice of involving fb in the costing process is only required for projects with costs in excess of $250k.
"in addition, fb and bms staff mentioned in interviews that they are interested in being involved in a periodic review of projects whose actual level of effort exceeded the portfolio-s initial estimate to assist in the future pricing of cost-plus contracts."
the revenue management model is well understood across the organization.
tools and guidance are available to encourage standardization of revenue project execution.
"training, support and guidance are available."
the audit found that overall nrc revenue management framework is adequate.
"there are, however, opportunities to strengthen the framework design and compliance."
the audit noted that the revenue management framework needs improvement.
"the roles and responsibilities of business management support (bms), planning and reporting services (prs), finance branch (fb), and portfolio groups are clearly defined within their areas of operation; however, the interdependencies between each of the groups and expectations for information to be exchanged is not as clear."
"during interviews with fb staff, it was noted that occasionally a client negotiation will begin before a credit check or a historical accounts receivable review is conducted."
"however, there is currently no guidance provided on when a credit check should be performed."
"while roles and responsibilities of the owners of the revenue management framework are clear, integration of information between the key participants could be improved so that key business and information needs are understood and acted upon."
"however, the key business and information requirements need to be clarified between bms, prs, and fb."
it was noted that nrc is using forums known as communities of practice to share successes and ideas which can aid this practice and improve the transfer of critical information.
"for example, the current structuring of sap project systems (sap ps) is established in a way that does not require contract billing milestones to be input into the project structure."
complications have been noted by fb staff that they are not notified in a timely manner to invoice clients.
it was noted during interviews with prs that basic project elements are reviewed for existence and adequacy before the project is released.
"at the moment, projects are not monitored after they are released for execution so the only point of review occurs during the planning stage."
"information needs to be transferred and shared between the systems and stakeholders and as billing milestones are not required to be built into the project structure, there is a risk that critical information is not available to relevant stakeholders as required."
"expectations for monitoring the project from contracting, to project management, to accrual, to invoicing are not defined sufficiently to ensure information continues to be accurately captured and appropriately shared."
it was noted during interviews that fb is also not always informed if there is a contract amendment which could impact invoicing.
"although it was noted that there are some formal standardized guidance material such as the client agreement guidelines, some training and guidance is not formalized and staff rely on the passing of information from incumbent staff to new staff."
"this is working well for discussing and establishing best practices but it can lead to inconsistent learning, and through this, a non-standard approach to revenue management."
"however, as a result, inconsistent practices have been observed which contrasts with nrc-s 2013-2018 strategy calling for consistent policies and practices."
the audit found that this is performed adequately. nrc has employed an effective project review system with the prs group actively reviewing each project being entered into sap ps to ensure that all fundamental projects aspects are captured.
"this provides a strong oversight function, ensures projects are established appropriately and that the key information regarding the project is recorded."
"this is demonstrated by the fact, that of the contracts reviewed, 76% of sampled projects were planned adequately in sap ps as their planned revenues exceeded their planned costs as per the nrc-s pricing strategy."
"however, it should be noted that the remaining 24% (4/17) were not planned adequately as their planned costs exceeded planned revenues."
"however, it was noted in interviews that the use of nboss is not fully understood across the organization."
"interviewees also identified that project management competencies vary across portfolios, which can also lead to inconsistent or non-standardized project management practices."
"however, it has been observed that consistency is improving under the direction of portfolio project management offices coupled with the leadership of bms who has introduced standardization in pricing and contracting-in."
the costing tools align with the treasury board secretariat-s guide to costing when used appropriately.
it was noted that 90% of sampled contracts made use of the standard approved contracting-in templates.
"although intellectual property licensing agreements were out of scope, one of the two exceptions that were noted was due to a general manager signing a technology licensing agreement where the license granted the licensee exclusivity on the property in its field of use."
the second exception was a result of an employee signing on behalf of a director where they did not have delegated authority to do so.
further analysis of these projects was not conducted as substantive testing was limited to the examination of sampled transactions and not the project as a whole.
"in addition, it was noted that the comptroller is not always included in reviewing financial information in a proposed contract, as it is left to the project managers- judgment to ask for assistance."
"it is should be understood that although fb may not be able to, or even be required, to review all cost calculations it should be involved in complex or large dollar values situations."
recommendation 3: business management support should improve the layout of standard contracting-in templates while enforcing their use clearly differentiate between exclusive use technology licensing agreement templates and non-exclusive use using a clear visual indicator revisit legacy agreements before they are renewed to ensure that pricing and terms and conditions are renegotiated based on a revised estimation of level of effort using updated cost rates appendix a: audit criteria line of enquiry audit criteria nrc-s revenue management framework is adequately designed to support the execution of nrc-s strategy nrc-s revenue management is supported by adequately defined roles and responsibilities.
"implementation of the nrc revenue framework produces adequate information for decision making revenue generating projects are planned and recorded adequately in sap ps nrc leverages systems to produce reliable and relevant information for decision making revenue project initiatives are managed in accordance with nrc-s strategy revenue management is in compliance with nrc and government of canada policies and related directives revenue management templates are appropriately used revenue projects are managed in accordance with the financial signing authority matrix revenue contracts are managed in accordance with nrc and tbs costing, pricing and risk management principles."
regional allocations should reflect eligible program populations.
changes in funding allocations to regions will likely have important impact on recipients.
"implementation timelines should factor-in consultations and notifications, in line with the annual funding cycle."
"document the current methodologies to fund the psssp recipients - april 2015 calculate new regional allocations and analyse impact on recipients - june 2015 consult with recipients 2015-2016 confirm new allocations to recipients - fall 2016 implementation - april1, 2017 as a subsequent phase to reviewing regional allocations, national guidance will be provided on the management of funds to recipients with a view to maximize program results."
"assistant deputy minister, esdpp in consultation with the cfo and regional operations sector april 2017 june 2017 the assistant deputy minister of esdpp should develop a clear and formal strategy and plan as to how and when eis reporting capabilities will be leveraged in support of the effective management and control of pse programs (i.e. what reports, how often, to whom, etc.) as well as how training will support improved accuracy and consistency of data collection."

psssp data for 2012-2013 available in the education reporting and analysis solution (eras).
"the eras produces dashboards, results by recipients and performance measures."
it will be used to define national guidance in regional allocation methodology noted in action item 1 above.
"psssp data for 2013-2014 available in eras psssp data for 2014-2015 available in eras assistant deputy minister, esdpp jointly with senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations september 2015 december 2015 spring 2016 the assistant deputy minister of esdpp should establish an implementation plan and timeline for implementing esdpp-s new compliance regime within pse."
"esdpp adm will implement the esdpp compliance regime on april 1, 2015."
the sadm of regional operations remains responsible for resourcing the regional offices with capacity to conduct compliance.

"assistant deputy minister, esdpp senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations april 2016 march 31, 2017 the assistant deputy minister of esdpp should clarify and confirm pspp program objectives in terms of their priority and alignment with broader departmental priorities."
pspp national program guidelines will be reviewed to clarify and confirm program objectives.
"as national guidelines, dci and call for proposals are already published and finalized for 2015-2016, this will be considered for 2016-2017. consider new performance indicators and review dci national selection committee will review lessons learned from the 2015-2016 process to see how much reduction in resources level was achieved compared to 2014-2015. if further reductions of efforts are necessary, alternative options will be explored in the summer of 2015. publish terms of reference for the national selection process for pspp assistant deputy minister, esdpp december 2015 fall 2016 fall 2015 the assistant deputy minister of esdpp should strengthen key elements of control to support overall governance of the pse programs."
sadm of regional operations to develop its human resources strategy and business plan for regional offices which are responsible for program delivery and monitoring.
the plans should be done in consultation with esdpp adm who has the lead for program policy.
"the audit criteria were drawn from the management accountability framework, treasury board policies, prior audit and evaluation reports, as well as aandc-s internal requirements."
"mechanisms are in place to monitor, assess and address the alignment of program objectives with program resource capacity."
mechanisms are in place to ensure funding allocation methodologies employed across the department promote consistent implementation of the psssp/ucep programs and equitable access to funding by eligible students in different regions.
reporting requirements facilitate the ability to monitor psssp recipients and improve overall programming.

"based on the outcomes of this review and overall program objectives, the adm, esdpp should develop national guidance to support the consistency of funding allocation methodologies employed by regions while enabling regional differences when warranted."
"in the interim, develop a risk-based approach to monitoring whereby a minimum standard for compliance monitoring and follow-up across all regions is established and sustained."
"esdpp will use this regime - which is risk-based, to input into the regional compliance plans in 2015-2016."
"following this clarification and confirmation, the program should develop relevant performance indicators and align these with the program dci; and identify and implement efficiencies in proposal review process to ensure that the resources and effort spent is commensurate with program-s significance, materiality and risk."
"in particular, it is recommended that: a program-specific risk assessment should be completed by education branch on pse programs upon which to implement risk-based controls to mitigate identified risks; a resourcing plan be developed to align the required level of resources with the operational needs for program delivery and monitoring activities."
the education branch risk profile will be reviewed for inclusion of pse-specific risks and include pse-specific mitigation strategy.
"assistant deputy minister, esdpp senior assistant deputy minister, regional operations december 2015 as per planning cycle appendix a: audit criteria to ensure an appropriate level of assurance to meet the audit objective, criteria were developed to address each of the assertions included within the scope of the audit (as provided in section 2 of this report)."
"the criteria for the audit, in order that they appear in this audit report, were as follows: audit criteria management and delivery of pssp and ucep psssp and ucep programs have implemented appropriate processes, procedures and supporting tools to monitor and promote the achievement of program objectives."
"appropriate policies, procedures, and tools have been developed and are being used to facilitate the achievement of pspp-s objectives."
"recommendations management response / actions responsible manager (title) planned implementation date program response the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management, as sap-gcims project sponsor, should review gate approvals for the sap-gcims project and assess whether requirements specified in the project portfolio management framework have been met."
"as of may 28, 2014: the project addressed standard project deliverables called for by aandc-s project management framework for gate-s 1 through 4, including business case, project charter, project plans, high level architecture (blueprint)."
gate 5 and 6 deliverables were tracked as follows (by system): gcims: requirements were recorded within a change management control system (test track pro) for individual changes.
"multiple changes went into each gcims release; test plans were developed for each release and a complete list of documented test scenarios was available with test scripts for each scenario; testing was centrally managed under a qa manager and test results were printed, signed and retained in a central file; and, user acceptance testing was undertaken by user business unit representatives in a formal user acceptance testing environment (i.e. aandc, phac, spb-hc) sap: requirements were documented by business analysts with the engagement of business owners."
formal audit trail of requirements included signed-off sap blueprint and gap documents.
detailed requirements were developed and retained by sap business analysts.
overall satisfaction with sap functionality was a key part of approvals for sap releases.
"gate 6 approvals for system releases, system user roll-outs and data conversions had explicit go/no-go criteria."
"to date (as of april 24th), there have been 4 gcims enhancement releases, 2 sap enhancement releases, 3 gcims user releases, 13 aandc sap user-wave releases, and 9 sap conversion releases."
clearly documented go/no-go criteria for each gate 6 and a precise schedule were presented in slide decks to the joint dg committee in slides and diagrams but not documented in detailed project plans in advance.
the gating process will be looked at from a lessons learned perspective.
"as of june 25, 2014: the lessons learned (included in the requirements for gate 7) and differences between the gate 5 and 6 approval processes for system releases, user roll-outs and conversions are scheduled to be documented by december 31, 2014. director general (dg), corporate accounting and material management (camm) december 31, 2014 program response : status: completed update/rationale: as of march 31, 2015 gcims: gcims completed the deliverables for gate 5 and 6."
"hc now is on board with gcims, and is looking to implement new major enhancements to satisfy their corporate priorities."
sap: sap documented the lessons learned in the project close out report. aes: implementation complete. recommendation to be closed. closed.
"the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management, as sap-gcims project sponsor, should review business requirements documented in the business case, blueprint documents, and sap functional gaps document, and confirm that requirements have been met by the delivered systems."
"if gaps exist, temporary work-arounds should be documented, and outstanding requirements retained for consideration in future releases."
the chief information officer should consider amending the project portfolio management framework to include tracking of business requirements among its mandatory deliverables for system implementation projects.
"given that changes were implemented by an established development team who, as a team, were accustomed to the established set of operational change management protocols, the documenting and approval of requirements within addda-s ttp system worked well."
"given the aggressive timeline of this large custom system initiative, this approach served the project outcome very well."
the full audit trail of detailed requirements is available but within an operational tool rather than within project documents.
(note: gcims releases 7.3.0 through to 7.4.0 constitute the project changes).
the sap fit gap document was last updated in the fall 2013.
this document identified aandc business requirements and whether there was an sap solution.
"for sap changes, detailed requirements were defined and documented by individual business analysts much as they would in their operational role under hc established sap support practices."
the documentation of requirements could certainly have been undertaken more as a project than operational releases.
hc will manage and track all partner ongoing sap requirements under the guidance of the joint governance committees as defined in the sap slas.
we agree with the recommendation and will take this forward in a lessons learned perspective for processes involving system implementation projects.
"as of june 25, 2014: overall project lessons learned (included in the requirements for gate 7) are scheduled to be documented by december 31, 2014."
greater effort will be undertaken to ensure a project approach to documentation in future projects.
"dg, camm chief information officer december 31, 2014 program response : status: completed update/rationale: as of march 31, 2015 the gcims/sap project is completed."
"it is currently at gate 7. proper documentation was used throughout the project using ttpro for defects and minor change requests, word documents for testing scenarios and business requirements."
"gcims and sap documented the lessons learned through the project close out report. aes: implementation complete. recommendation to be closed. closed the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management, as the sap-gcims project sponsor, should work with health canada to ensure that service agreements specific to health canada's role as an sap service provider are drafted and finalized."
"furthermore, a steering committee for the ongoing partnership between the two departments should include in its mandate the monitoring of the performance of hc as service provider to ensure that services levels are being met."
"as of may 28, 2014: at the time of this initial finding: a draft sla is in process and is targeting completion by april 1, 2014. steering committee-s role and performance measures are to be addressed within the sla including continuing after the april 1, 2014 go-live."
"as of june 25, 2014: a final draft sap master agreement and sla documents have been created that outline performance standards as well as governance structure and responsibilities."
"these documents are scheduled to be signed off by july 31, 2014 as they are addressing the final cost elements."
"dg, camm july 31, 2014 revised date: q3 2015-2016 status: in progress the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management should develop an operating model for a support organization for gcims as a hosted system for other gc departments."
service level agreements (slas) with health canada for the provision of gcims services should align with treasury board of canada secretariat guidelines on service agreements and service standards.
"as of may 28, 2014: as per the recommendation to use the tbs guidelines on service agreements and service standards, initial drafts of an mou for gcims operations services as well as a detailed service level agreement, have been developed."
the detailed sla contains an operating model for the gcims post-implementation support organization.
discussions with our partners started on february 7th on the content of the mou and the detailed sla.
"as of march 18th, mou discussions are complete."
"the draft mou has been shared with aandc, hc and phac senior management for their review and comments."
the sla work sessions with hc and phac are complete and draft slas have been shared for input/comments.
"as of june 25, 2014: the memorandum of understanding and service level agreement for gcims have been revised to be separated into two distinct documents: one for phac and one for hc; and are under review by hc and phac senior management."
review of ongoing costing requirements is being finalized by hc and phac.
"finalize and secure endorsement from adms/cfos of both mou and sla by july 31, 2014."
"dg, camm july 31, 2014 revised date: q3 2015-2016 status: in progress the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management, with assistance from the chief information officer, should prepare a plan for the gcims technical support organization that includes technical and business analyst resources, a client service function, and other functions required to support the ongoing development, update, and deployment of the gcims application."
"as of may 28, 2014: as per recommendation #4, detailed sla and changes to gcims support roles are scheduled for q3 2014-15 and will be in place on time to support hc-s 1,100 users."
the detailed sla will document the organization and necessary resources.
"as of june 25, 2014: indeterminate employees and new contracted resources have been added to transition knowledge for functional, technical support and maintenance of the application."
the desired team structure has been identified and a maintenance plan has been developed to assist in ensuring that the technical support has a standard change process and management structure to maintain the application.
"dg, camm chief information officer december 31, 2014 revised date: q3 2015-2016 status: in progress the director general, corporate accounting and materiel management, as sap-gcims project sponsor, should ensure that activities described in aandc-s business transformation strategy - particularly those related to the cutover to the new sap system - are completed by the sap project team, and results of these activities communicated to aandc management."
"as of may 28, 2014: business process maps were to be used in a series of impact assessment workshops and business readiness assessment."
these were not accomplished as scheduled and required several changes to approach.
specifically including: key business processes were reviewed with business owners within corporate services and hubs.
the updating of the full set of business processes identifying resulting process controls is scheduled for completion post-project inception.
"with respect to implementing sap to support grants and contributions business processes, changes to gcims have no impact on organizational structure or processes at aandc with the exception of what is necessary to support the hc portfolio."
once finalized the results will be communicated.
"as of june 25, 2014: a completeness review of business process maps and refinements to clearly state business and system controls is scheduled to be completed by december 31, 2014."
"dg, camm december 31, 2014 program response : status: completed update/rationale: as of march 31, 2015 the sap business process maps completeness review has been performed and documented."
aes: implementation complete. recommendation to be closed. closed.
"appendix a: audit criteria audit criteria were developed to align with the audit objective and cobit, an industry standard framework of control objectives for information and technology: audit criteria project management and governance project management and governance structure has been established to provide oversight, ensure deadlines are met, ensure scope is adhered to, and ensure objectives are met."
a steering committee has been established that has a clear mandate and representation from key stakeholder groups.
a project plan has been established and accepted by all parties and stakeholders to assist in meeting project deadlines and objectives.
functional readiness changes to financial business processes have been analyzed and reviewed with business users.
"key project business requirements documentation has been developed and approved by project stakeholders, including change requests."
security requirements have been analyzed and a plan has been established to ensure adherence to departmental and gc security requirements.
"a comprehensive testing strategy and plan has been developed for all business process changes and data migrations, which includes business user involvement."
adequate testing has been planned for data migration.
adequate testing has been planned for interfaces.
"deployment readiness a system cutover plan is part of the overall project plan, and includes documented conversion specifications."
"for major milestones, management documents go/no-go criteria and subsequent decisions."
a communication plan informs stakeholders and management of the progress of the roll-out.
aandc has defined its processes related to its role as a service provider of gcims to health canada.
"if there are changes, documentation is updated accordingly."
"a training program has been developed, and executed prior to deployment of the new system; affected business functions are trained prior to implementation."
an organization-wide change management plan to identify and document technical and operational aspects of the system to sap users at aandc has been prepared and implemented.
testing of sap functionality was undertaken and confirmed through the aandc sap business analysts.
user acceptance testing was not planned.
this gap in detailed plans and in the timely updating of risk logs and issues logs contributed to regular delays in establishing monthly project dashboards.
"as of: may 28, 2014: the finding is correct that: documentation of (gcims) business requirements was managed within the software development team, consistent with previous releases of the software; however, tracking of business requirements was not formally documented by the project."
"in some exceptions, hc made some sap customizations for aandc where the current sap solution did not meet aandc requirements and a business process work around was not possible."
greater effort could be undertaken to ensure this approach in future projects.
adequate and appropriate resources have been assigned to execute the project plan.
"issues and risks are formally identified, tracked, managed, and resolved in a timely and appropriate manner."
aandc has established appropriate mechanisms with health canada related to its post-project role as a service provider to aandc for sap.
business process readiness business process controls are reviewed for potential changes based on changes to business processes.
management accepts the recommendations of internal audit.
the recommendations recognize that the accountability for performance measurement is shared by all departmental managers.

important planning documents such as the business plan and rpp will be used to pinpoint areas in the branch that could benefit from the development and implementation of pms-s.
"partnership governance the partnership governance structure was created to enable joint discussion, and the establishment and communication of strategic priorities and objectives (refer to figure 1)."
this committee is composed of representatives from each of the client partners.
"the sap partnership management committee (spmc): director general led standing committee focused on the functionality, operations and management of the sap service for the partnership."
this committee is composed of representatives from each of the client partners.
centre of excellence (coe): aafc-based organization that is responsible to deliver sap system solutions that adhere to the strategic objectives and priorities directed by the spsc and spmc.
the coe provides system development and support services for the sap solution.
"change control committee (ccc): aafc-led group that assists in the assessment, prioritization and scheduling of changes."
client advisor: an individual designated by each client partner to act as the key contact person and liaison to the partnership.
"client partner forums: groups that support the governance by working closely with the centre of excellence to provide operational subject matter expertise to the partnership by helping to plan and prioritize business requirements, identify operational issues and act as a conduit for information sharing and knowledge transfer."
the spsc and the spmc do not meet at frequencies that are in accordance with those specified in the sla.
the sap partnership steering committee met only once during the 15-month audit period (1 out of an expected 3+) and sap partnership management committee met twice during the same period (2 out of an expected 5).
the service level agreement (sla) that specifies the expected frequency of governance meetings was developed at a time when the sap partnership was new to all parties.
"as the partners now have many years of experience and familiarity in working with the sap solution and each other, it is possible that the frequency in the sla no longer reflects the frequency that is required or expected by all partners."
aafc 1 management response: agree action plan: frequency of the governance meeting will be re-assessed jointly during the upcoming dg/adm governance meetings in order to address the needs of the partnership.
the service level agreement will be updated accordingly.
"target date for completion: january 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer it controls it controls are broadly defined as activities performed by persons or it systems, to ensure that the it applications continually operate as designed to support the achievement of business objectives and the integrity of data."
it controls are assessed within two main categories: it general controls (itgcs) and application controls.
"it general controls itgcs represent the broad foundation of the it control environment, and are primarily manual in their operation."
"itgcs traditionally fall within three categories: it change management, user access management and it operations."
results for each category are described in detail below.
"it change management it change management controls are key in supporting the continued operations and evolution of it applications, and contribute to ensuring it applications and supporting infrastructure function as intended in a consistent manner."
"the centre of excellence (coe) is responsible for performing system development and support services, including the prioritizing, planning, designing, developing, testing and implementation of service requests."
"to track changes and control the entire change management process, the aafc coe uses a custom module within sap called the change management system."
functional testing: changes are subject to functional testing by members of the coe.
"change monitoring: the use of super user accounts used to transport changes to production, and other privileged activities related to change management, are effectively monitored by the coe."
"strength: all changes that were examined followed the change management process in a controlled manner, and changes were planned to minimize impact on operations."
"finding within the software development lifecycle, user acceptance testing (uat) (also referred to as end user testing) is an activity in which software is tested by the intended audience or business users prior to being moved into production."
"uat is key within the it change management suite of controls, because it is critical that changes have the intended effect within the context of the impacted business processes."
"aafc 2 management response: agree action plan: in collaboration with the client partners, the change management process will be improved to include consideration of user acceptance testing going forward."
"target date for completion: april 1, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer user access management user access management controls govern how access to applications is restricted, provisioned, modified and removed, to help ensure that only authorized individuals have access to data and related it applications, and have the ability to perform only specifically authorized functions."
strong logical access control environments include a balance of both preventative and detective controls.
"controls pertaining to user access approvals, user access revocation, password requirements and security configuration settings are considered key preventative controls, while detective controls generally consist of periodic review of access rights and monitoring of user activity."
"the aafc centre of excellence (coe) in collaboration with client partners, have developed an effectively designed approval process for new access, which includes definitions of roles and identification of approvers; and the access provisioning process is consistently executed by the coe."
the coe consistently removes access in a timely manner upon receiving requests from client partners.
findings the audit also identified opportunities to improve the user access management control environment.
"while the coe consistently removes access in a timely manner upon receiving requests from client partners, it was observed that the coe is not consistently notified by client partners in a timely manner upon the departure of users."
this is due to each client partners- employee departure process not being well-integrated with sap access removal processes.
"user accounts belonging to employees who have left the organizations could remain active for up to a year, and accessed by unauthorized users (i.e. if account is used frequently enough so that automatic locking due to inactivity after 30 days is not applied)."
recommendation aafc 3/cfia 1/nrcan 1 - each client partner should re-assess its: departure process to ensure that the coe is notified in a timely manner of all departures of employees that have sap access rights.
aafc 3 management response: agree action plan: aafc 3 (first bullet): aafc will re-assess its departure process to ensure that the sap coe is notified in a timely manner of all departures.
"target date for completion: march 1, 2016 lead(s) responsible: assistant deputy minister, corporate management branch action plan: aafc 3 (second bullet): sap coe will communicate and engage with its partners in order to put in place a standard user access review process."
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer cfia 1 management response: agree action plan: the accounting operations group does strive to notify the coe of a departing employee with sap access rights."
the issue is more with employees who leave a position for another within the agency.
the proposed periodic review (below) will help to address those situations.
"while the agency does conduct an intensive sap user review, it is only done annually."
the accounting operations division will conduct either a quarterly or semi-annual review aimed more at the users rather than their roles to ensure that (1) the people are still in the position and that (2) they still requires the sap access held.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director, accounting operations nrcan 1 management response: agree."
"action plan: nrcan has recently implemented a new departure process (march 2015), which is integrated with sap access rights."
"in addition, automated reports will compare sap access information to other systems such as the salary forecasting module and directory of people and services (dps)."
"also, please note that compensatory controls currently exist, whereby user accounts are inactivated if users do not access sap for a period of 90 days."
the key control areas assessed as part of the audit were data backups and scheduled processing (i.e. batch jobs).
the centre of excellence (coe) is responsible for executing key controls related to it operations.
"strength: it operations controls related to data backup and scheduled processing are managed in a controlled manner, and monitoring of automated processing is performed."
application controls application controls are automated in nature and are embedded within business processes (e.g. sap will not allow an unbalanced transaction to be posted).
"in some cases, the descriptions of automated application controls pertaining to business processes of aafc, cfia and nrcan do not accurately align with the sap system-s functionality."
"while minor opportunities for improvement were identified pertaining to the accuracy of documented control descriptions, the audit determined that the automated application controls are designed and operating effectively."
"the list of controls for which there are opportunities to improve the accuracy of the control descriptions, has been provided to management."
a business continuity plan (bcp) enables client partners to respond to business disruptions in order to continue the operation of critical functions and services.
disaster recovery planning is focused on recovering it assets from disasters or disruptions.
"a disaster recovery plan (drp) is a critical component enabling the partnership to respond to incidents and disruptions in order to continue the operation of the sap solution and related it infrastructure, as well as maintain the availability of information at a level acceptable to the client partners."
a drp describes procedures and arrangements in place to recover critical it assets within a predetermined time frame.
"findings as per the sap partnership service level agreement (sla), each client partner is responsible for performing their own business impact analysis (bia) and corresponding business continuity plan (bcp) (if warranted by the bia results) for services supported by sap."
finding 5: business continuity documentation requires updates and improvements so that aafc and cfia are prepared to continue the operation of critical functions and services in a timely manner in the event of a business disruption.
"as per the partnership sla, each member of the partnership has individual responsibilities regarding disaster recovery planning."
"while nrcan and cfia data is replicated and backed up by the same methods as aafc-s data, there are no provisions to provide client partners- personnel workspaces and connectivity at the hot site in the event of a business disruption or disaster."
recommendations aafc 4 - aafc should complete the in-progress business continuity plan refresh to update and approve its business continuity plan to ensure departmental readiness.
aafc 4 management response: agree action plan: the sap business continuity plan is completed and approved at the dg level and will be submitted for final approval.
"target date for completion: december 1, 2015 lead(s) responsible: chief information officer cfia 2 - cfia should reassess the criticality of the sap application."
"if services supported by sap are subsequently determined to no longer be critical, then the business impact analysis should be updated accordingly."
the requirements to continue critical services in the event that the sap and it infrastructure are unavailable should be documented in the business continuity plan.
cfia should engage aafc to implement arrangements so that its business and it requirements for sap will be met in the event of a disaster.
"the arrangements should be supported by formal documentation describing the agreement, cost model and resources that will be made available to cfia in the event of a disaster."
it will be changed to a mad of 8 to 21 days (level 4) during the next review.
"the most critical service provider supporting the partnership-s sap environment is shared services canada (ssc), as they are responsible for hosting and maintaining the it infrastructure."
"ssc was created on august 4, 2011, and it infrastructure-related services that were formerly performed by aafc were subsequently transitioned to ssc."
the audit assessed service provider governance in the following key areas: disaster recovery planning and it infrastructure change management.
"disaster recovery planning finding it is critical that there is a high-level of communication and coordination between the partnership and ssc, due to ssc-s integral role in disaster recovery."
the audit identified that aafc and ssc do not regularly meet to discuss strategic or operational requirements in support of disaster recovery for the sap environment.
"additionally, due to the relocation of the backup data centre, the primary and backup data centres supporting the sap application are now within close proximity (~5km), which is not aligned with best practices."
"the primary and backup data centres are in close proximity, increasing the likelihood that a particular disaster or disruption could affect both data centres simultaneously, thereby hindering the timely recovery of the sap environment."
"it infrastructure change management finding the audit identified that effective communication channels were not in place for aafc to be advised in a consistent and timely manner of it changes at the infrastructure level that may cause unavailability of the sap application, which prevents advance notice and disclosure to client partners."
"since the creation of shared services canada (ssc), the extent of communication with, and involvement of, ssc personnel in the aafc change management process has decreased, and ssc representatives no longer attend the change control meetings at aafc."
recommendation aafc 5 - aafc should collaborate with shared services canada to formalize service level agreements or other business arrangements so that: the disaster recovery plan (drp) is continually updated to reflect the current environment.
the drp documentation should clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between the partnership and ssc in the event of a disaster.
the location of the backup data centre and hot site is re-assessed and remediated as necessary.
planned infrastructure changes with potential impact on sap availability are consistently discussed with client partners in a timely manner.
aafc 5 management response: agree action plan: aafc will collaborate with ssc to ensure sap service expectations and needs are fully understood and work with ssc to: formalize the periodic review and adjustment to the drp to reflect the current sap environment including the delineation of roles and responsibilities for aafc and ssc in the event of a disaster.
request that the location of the backup data centre (hot site) for sap be re-assessed and remediated as necessary.
define the approach for ssc to have timely discussions with aafc on proposed infrastructure changes with an anticipated impact on sap.

"the governance model created to establish, deploy and monitor the strategic, tactical and operational layers of the sap partnership includes the following structures: the sap partnership steering committee (spsc): assistant deputy minister standing committee that provides leadership and sets the strategic direction of the partnership, and is the final approval body for change, management of escalated issues and risk mitigation."
figure 1 - partnership governance structure finding the audit determined that the partnership governance structure was implemented as designed in the governing service level agreement for the sap solution (refer to figure 1); however areas for improvement were identified.
"as a result, there is an increased risk that issues hindering the achievement of strategic priorities and objectives are not identified and resolved in a timely manner."
"finding 1: a governance structure with senior level participation for strategic planning, decision-making and problem resolution is adequately designed and established, however it is not operating as defined in the partnership sla."
"recommendation aafc 1 - aafc, in collaboration with the other partners, should strengthen the governance processes by jointly re-assessing the service level agreement (sla) requirements to determine if the required frequency of governance meetings is appropriate based on the needs of the partnership, and update the sla if necessary."
aafc should designate a lead or develop a process to schedule governance committee meetings at the agreed upon frequency and with appropriate representation.
a lead will be designated to schedule governance committee meetings at the agreed upon frequency and with appropriate representation.
"the audit observed that all changes examined followed the change management process as defined in the service level agreement and the change management service agreement, and the following key control points are in place and operating effectively: change initiation: changes are initiated by appropriate personnel based on business or technical operational requirements."
change approval: changes are approved by appropriate personnel before being moved into production.
"segregation of incompatible duties: there is an appropriate segregation of incompatible duties among those involved in key responsibilities: approving, developing and moving changes to production."
"within the partnership environment, uat is of increased importance because there may be nuanced differences to each client partners- business processes that the coe is not aware of; and therefore there is a higher risk that changes may have an unintended effect if not tested by client partners prior to being moved to production."
there is a risk that changes do not meet clients- needs or do not function as intended by all client partners.
"in some cases, the lack of client involvement has resulted in inefficiencies, because additional change requests had to be completed to meet clients' needs."
"recommendation aafc 2 - aafc, in collaboration with the client partners, should augment the change management process to include consideration for user acceptance testing based on risk before changes are made to the sap application and its supporting it environment."
the audit assessed controls in the following key user access management areas: passwords security configuration access to privileged it functions user access monitoring user access provisioning user access removal user access periodic review and certification strengths: password controls are appropriate and aligned with communication security establishment canada-s standards.
key sap configuration and security settings are appropriate.
"privileged it functions at the sap application layer, including access to sensitive transactions, default sap profiles, and sap authorization objects are limited to appropriate individuals."
controls to monitor sensitive and higher-risk users- access rights and activities are effective in design and operation over the audit period.
there is a risk that unauthorized users could access the sap application through departed employees- user accounts.
"it was expected that reviews were performed by appropriate it or business management personnel, at a reasonable frequency and following a risk-based approach so that the level of effort in performing the review was commensurate with the associated risks (e.g. moderate and higher-risk users should be reviewed more frequently than lower risk users, who may only require an annual review)."
"the audit identified that each client partner's periodic user access review is only performed on an annual basis, which is not a sufficient frequency to mitigate risks related to deficiencies in the access removal process (refer to paragraph 2.2.9)."
"finding 4: each client partner's periodic user access review is only performed on an annual basis, which is not a sufficient frequency to mitigate risks related to deficiencies in the access removal process."
"periodic user access review process, and consider adopting a more frequent (e.g. on a quarterly basis) and risk-based approach."
"aafc will re-assess its user access review process and consider adopting a more frequent, risk-based approach."
targeted areas (e.g. accounts payable) may also be used when pursuing a risk-based approach.
"with respect to adopting a more frequent access review process, nrcan will introduce a semi-annual review for higher risk access profiles, such as corporate reporting and section 33 officers."
this additional compensatory control will serve to further mitigate related risk.
"target date for completion: march 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director finance and procurement services, finance and procurement branch it operations the objective of it operations controls is to provide a reliable processing environment and mitigate risks related to the loss of it applications and data, and the incomplete processing of information."
the audit determined that the suite of backup controls and redundancy built into the architecture reasonably mitigates the risk related to data backups.
"additionally, controls to identify and resolve deviations from scheduled processing (e.g. batch job failures) in a timely manner are effective in design and operation over the audit period, and access to make changes to the job schedules is restricted to appropriate coe individuals."
"business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning every organization is at risk from potential business disruptions caused by various incidents and disasters, which could include: natural disasters such as tornadoes, floods, blizzards, earthquakes and fire accidents sabotage power and energy disruptions communications, transportation, safety and service sector failure environmental disasters such as pollution and hazardous materials spills cyber-attacks and hacker activity."
"the audit assessed each client partner-s bia and bcp and determined that the latest complete and approved aafc bcp was from march 2012, although a bcp refresh is currently in progress."
there is a risk that aafc is not well positioned to continue business operations in a timely manner in the event of a business disruption.
"for cfia, the business continuity plan documentation provided as part of this audit did not provide for scenarios where the sap application would be impacted."
"nrcan-s business impact analysis did not identify any critical functions or services that rely on sap; therefore, the audit did not expect to find evidence of a business continuity plan and a disaster recovery plan (drp) related to sap."
"the service level agreement between the client partners states that -the cost model for the sap solution does not include disaster recovery planning or business continuity planning-, however -should a client partner be interested in creating a drp with the assistance of aafc, this would be addressed separately-."
"based on the nrcan business impact analysis, this would not impact the ability of nrcan to deliver critical functions or services."
"cfia-s business requirements for sap, as defined in its business impact analysis, may not be met in the event of a disaster."
"however, management has stated that it believes that sap is not a critical service and therefore, the business and it requirements in its business impact analysis are inaccurate."
"finding 6: for the sap application, cfia does not have arrangements in place to enable business and it requirements, as defined in its business impact analysis, to be met in the event of a disaster."
"if sap is confirmed as being critical, then the following improvements to the business continuity plan documentation and recovery arrangements should be made to enable the continuity of critical functions and services: cfia should update the business continuity plan documentation to include scenarios in which sap and it infrastructure is impacted or unavailable."
"target date for completion: july 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: director, accounting operations service provider governance partnering with third party service providers can provide significant benefits, such as reduced cost and increased efficiency, however the use of such providers also introduces additional risks that need to be managed accordingly."
the audit determined that the aafc disaster recovery plan (drp) was most recently updated in march 2012 and did not reflect the transfer of data centre responsibilities to ssc.
ssc subsequently changed the location of the sap system's backup data centre from a winnipeg facility to an ottawa facility; however the sap drp has not been updated to reflect the current environment.
"primary and backup data centres should have sufficient separation and differences between geography, climate, seismology, and power grids."
there is a risk that aafc is not well positioned to recover it assets in a timely manner in the event of a disaster.
"overall, there is a risk that contingencies to support disaster recovery are not sufficient to recover from certain types of disasters in a timely manner."
finding 7: the disaster recovery plan does not reflect the current environment or clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between the partnership and ssc.
"although meetings between aafc and ssc occur at the senior management level, there are no change management meetings attended by both ssc and aafc representatives."
finding 8: effective governance structures are not in place in support of consistent and timely communication of changes at the infrastructure level that may cause unavailability of the sap application to enable disclosure to all partners and minimize impacts on operations.
this section outlines the findings and recommendations with respect to the gs&cs modernization audit.
appendix a provides a summary of all findings and conclusions for each of the criteria assessed by the audit team.
"governance governance is the internal control component that involves establishing key oversight bodies for the organization and ensuring a clearly communicated mandate that includes roles and responsibilities, accountabilities and decision-making authority is documented in a formal project charter."
governance structure the eos project has a governance structure in place that is well-structured and functions as designed.
documentation is consistently developed to support meetings and decisions.
the governance structure for the project functions effectively.
committee members are aware of their responsibilities and accountabilities.
"the governance structure for the project is illustrated below: committee and working group meetings are held consistently to support the nature of the committee or team (monthly for the project steering committee, weekly to bi-weekly for the project management office and project team, and as required for the program dg working group), with documentation, such as agendas and records of decision , prepared and communicated."
the records of decisions reflect a level of detail of the discussion and issues raised in the meetings and also identify decisions taken and follow-up action required.
alignment with departmental and central agency priorities the eos project is aligned with departmental and relevant central agency requirements.
"this is the result of the frequent meetings held with central agencies and ogds such as treasury board secretariat (tbs), western economic diversification canada and the department of justice canada."
"additionally, eos is clearly linked to the requirements of the tb policy on service and other existing tb policies."
memoranda of understanding are under review with tbs to ensure this alignment continues.
aligning with departmental and tb priorities is an important element of project success to ensure the effective use of resources and organizational alignment across both pch and the government of canada.
"given the nature of eos, this is especially important as there is an initiative to create standardized gs&cs solutions across government."
"the eos project has sound processes and practices related to feedback from clients using techniques and channels such as; regional visits, phone calls, and surveys."
the project has provided clear and timely feedback and communications to its clients and ogds.
"the success of engagement and feedback gathering activities is due, in part, to the shared vision and integrated strategy of the project as two of the three pillars of the project action plan - enhanced client relationship and standardized business process - focus on wide spread engagement."
"while there are sound processes and practices related to feedback, the audit team has concluded that improvements related to change management should be enhanced."
"though eos change management activities as part of its project plan, the gcmap lacks an overall change management strategy."
"additionally, a communication strategy should be developed to articulate how gs&cs modernization and the eos will impact the delivery of gs&cs going forward."
"given the nature and reach of the project, user buy-in is critical to project success."
"recommendation the chief transformation and information officer should implement a comprehensive change management and communications strategy for gcmap, including the implications of eos."
"internal control internal control is broadly defined as a process, affected by an entity-s management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives."
system security testing testing of system security has yet to be carried out at the time of the audit.
system security is a shared responsibility between pch and ssc.
"while pch is responsible for application level security, ssc is responsible for security at the network, operating system and platform layers of an it solution."
"for the eos project, pch engaged a security expert to develop a system security architecture design specification to ensure the necessary technical controls were implemented in the context of the overall solution design commensurate with the confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements of the system."
"the security design specification identified controls required across across all layers of the it solution, but focused specifically on controls to be implemented at the application layer."
the security design specification was included as part of the rfp requirements in the selection and procurement of the eos system.
a security assessment & authorization (sa&a) process was undertaken to verify that the technical controls identified in the security architecture design specification document had been implemented and were functioning in accordance with their design.
the attestation evidence was accepted with a -security improvement plan- (sip) which provided for the testing of conrols post-release.
"ssc is responsible for the implementation of security controls at the network, operating system and physical layers."
pch requested a protected b environment for the eos system.
ssc provided the environment with confirmation that it met protected b requirements.
"they have not, and will not provide any testing evidence to validate this."
testing of requirements is critical to ensuring the integrity of a system.
"while evidence was submitted through the sa&a process that the necessary security controls have been implemented, these controls need to be tested to ensure they are operating in accordance with their design."
recommendation the chief transformation and information officer should: place a high priority on completing the testing of security and operational controls of eos; and seek formal assurance from ssc concerning the network and data centre infrastructure that supports the application.
transition to operation and maintenance planning to move from implementation to ongoing operation and maintenance of the system has yet to be developed.
the lifecycle of the eos allows for programs to be onboarded over several fiscal years.
"at the time of the audit, one gs&cs program, canada arts training fund (catf), had been onboarded and three additional programs were planned to be onboarded before the end of fiscal 2015-2016."
"the support requirements of programs that are already using gcmi-eos have moved into an operation and maintenance mode, whereas other programs have yet to be implemented, requiring a different set of service requirements."
"at the time of the audit, the it staff in the chief information officer branch (ciob) are supporting both the program that has been onboarded and the programs that continue to use legacy tools."
the audit team observed that the full cost and resource implications of the operation and maintenance of eos have not yet been fully defined.
"further, as part of the contract with the external contractor, there has been a knowledge transfer from the external contractor to pch it staff team through formal training and regular interactions."
"the department-s current grants and contributions information management system maintenance team has been included in the project to learn the newer technology and their day-to-day tasks are being conducted by temporary staff, contractors, and students."
"in spite of these positive steps, a clear distinction between development/onboarding and operation and maintenance support, resources, tools and procedures is not evident."
"recommendation the chief transformation and information officer should develop a plan, including clear roles and responsibilities, to support programs as they are onboarded and move to an ongoing operation and maintenance environment."
"overall conclusion the main purpose of this audit was to provide assurance that the eos project is on track to deliver a system, processes and controls that will contribute to achievement of gcmap project objectives, specifically objectives to enhance the client relationship, contribute to efficiency of business processes for programs, and improve performance measurement and reporting."
"there are specific improvements, as noted in the above sections, which would enable the eos project team and its steering committee to effectively implement the project, achieve its objectives, and measure and monitor performance."
a conclusion is not provided for security controls that are the responsibility of shared services canada.
appendix a - audit criteria the conclusions reached for each of the audit criteria used in the audit were developed according to the following definitions.
numerical categorization
"the findings are based on a combination of the evidence gathered through documentation review, analysis, testing, and interviews conducted for each audit criterion."
"findings of lesser materiality, risk or impact have been communicated with the auditee either verbally or in a management letter."
committees are made up of appropriate representatives who attend regularly.
"having an effective governance structure in place within pch for the eos project provides for appropriate oversight, engagement in decision-making and risk management processes and supports and reinforces strong oversight for the implementation of the project."
"that said, given the dg and adm membership of the gcmap steering committee, efficiencies could be gained by elevating this committee to a level 2 committee."
the audit team found that the project is aligned with departmental and relevant central agency requirements.
"by working closely with tbs and ogds, pch has effectively mitigated the risk that the eos project would not align with the wider governmental mandate for eos applications."
"feedback & change management the project has sound feedback gathering processes and procedures; however, it requires a robust change management strategy to address the anxieties and concerns of impacted employees."
the audit team also did not find a change management work breakdown structure to address anxieties and concerns of program staff who will experience changes in the way they conduct their work as a result of eos.
"while strong mechanisms for engaging with and gathering feedback from employees and ogds exist, there may be a risk that the lack of effective change management will create resistance with the effective implementation of the project."
"risk management in general, the eos risk management framework is robust."
"risk management is the internal control component that involves establishing and maintaining an effective framework and process to identify, analyze, and manage risks relevant to achieving objectives."
members of the project team indicated that the risk management framework is robust.
the objective of the framework is to provide the structure and tools to ensure all risks are effectively identified and managed across the project.
this is done primarily through the use of risk registers maintained by the gcmap project office.
the risk registers are tabled and reviewed at all meetings of the gcmap project management office and the project team.
the top three risks and key issues are included in the executive dashboard that is tabled at the gcmap steering committee.
having a formal enterprise risk management framework and documented approaches to managing these risks mitigates the risk that challenges and barriers to the project will go unaddressed.
regular reporting of risks through the risk register and project dashboard mitigates the risk that decision-makers are unaware or uninformed of risks to the project.
the team concluded that risk management practices for the eos porject are in place and operating effectively.
"at this time, the evidence submitted to confirm the implementation of the specified controls consisted of an -attestation- that the specified controls were implemented in accordance with the security architecture design; it did not include -test results- that the controls implemented were operating in accordance with their design."
"based on the attestation evidence, and the security improvement plan, the cio issued an -interim authority to operate- (iao) for 1 year."
"given the lack of security testing for the application, there is a risk that the gcmi-eos application may have security weaknesses that could place the accuracy and privacy of program application information in jeopardy as well as expose personal or client proprietary information to access by unauthorized individuals, either inside or outside the department."
"accordingly, there is a risk that the security controls are not operating effectively and the eos system susceptible to security breach or undesired functionality."
"however, the ciob has developed a training strategy for its it resources with regards to eos."
"without clear distinction between development/onboarding and operation and maintenance support, resources, tools and procedures, there is an increased risk that onboarded clients who are in operation and maintenance will continue to place demands on resources that assisted them during the onboarding exercise."
there is a risk that these development/implementation resources will be conflicted in the priority of their work assignments and impact the onboarding schedule.
"based on the audit findings, our opinion is the eos project has a sound governance structure and manages risks appropriately."

"based on the audit findings, our opinion is the eos project has a sound governance structure and manages risks appropriately."
this section presents detailed findings and related recommendations for the audit.
appendix a provides a summary of all findings and conclusions for each criterion assessed.
"governance capital celebrations and program operations directorate directions, objectives and mandate capital celebrations and program operations directorate directions, objectives and mandate are clearly defined, communicated and aligned with pch-s mandate, strategic objectives and priorities."
"the objective of ccpod is to foster pride amongst canadians towards their capital, while increasing their overall awareness of the canada-s capital region as a destination where people can experience canada-s heritage, culture and achievements."
"to meet its objectives, the directorate delivers the capital experience program that organizes events, such as canada day celebrations in canada-s capital region, winterlude and christmas lights across canada."
"in addition, ce has festival equipment that can be rented to not-for-profit associations and government agencies within ottawa, gatineau and the region."
"the audit team expected to find that ccpod, including the rpl objectives and mandate were clearly defined and communicated to employees and management and that there was alignment with pch-s mandate and strategic objectives."
the branch mandate and objectives are articulated and linked to the department-s mandate and priorities.
"in addition, the team found that employees and management understood the objectives and mandate of the directorate."
this information is available on the intranet and in key corporate documents.
performance measurement and reporting there are formal performance measures in place and reporting is provided to senior management on the results of capital celebrations and program operations directorate activities.
"best practices incorporate reporting on asset management activities into their regular management reporting to reinforce the importance of asset management practices, due diligence, and allows management to readily identify and respond to areas of priority to optimize the allocation of its resources."
"through the review of key corporate documents, the audit team observed performance information related to capital experience program; specifically, established and communicated expected results, performance indicators, targets and actual results."
"the team found that at the operational level, there was an understanding of the need to have assets available in assisting the delivery of planned events to meet ccpod performance objectives."
"formal, regular, and consolidated reporting on activities and performance enables management to monitor and respond to emerging and systemic issues in a proactive manner."
the pch directive for the management of moveable assets is the principal instrument applied in the management of pch assets.
"the directive came into effect june 15, 2010 and was established in accordance with the tb policy on the management of materiel."
"the objective of this directive is to ensure that moveable assets are effectively and efficiently used, managed and controlled in accordance with the principles of life cycle materiel management so that pch can realize maximum benefit from their use in program delivery."
"the audit team expected to find evidence of compliance to the policy and directive because moveable assets represent a significant investment for the department and their use has a direct impact on program delivery, making it essential that they be used effectively and efficiently."
"the directive indicates that all moveable assets are planned for, acquired, stored, transported and disposed of in accordance with the management of assets and acquired services framework, applying the principles of life cycle material management and modern comptrollership and in manner that adheres to the government-s objectives, legislation and policies."
a life cycle management plan should be developed to determine the effective and efficient management of assets from the identification of a requirement to the disposal and replacement of the asset acquired to meet the requirement.
"the phases of life cycle management include assessing requirements; analyzing options; planning acquisition; acquiring; operating, using, and maintaining; and disposing and replacing."
this would have a direct impact on ccpod-s operations and its ability to meet departmental activities and objectives.
"recommendation the director general of major events, commemorations and capital experience should develop and implement a life cycle management plan for ccpod assets."
"in addition, the team found that management and employees were not aware of the directive and its requirements."
"recommendation the director general, major events, commemorations and capital experience in consultation with the director of contracting and material management directorate, should ensure relevant asset management policies and directives are communicated to ccpod employees and that an asset management framework is established and implemented."
controls inventory system access control inventory systems access controls are in place and adequate.
"as per the treasury board secretariat-s operation security standard: management of information technology security (mits), it and information access must be restricted to individuals who have been screened and authorized, have been identified and authenticated, and have a -need to know.- the audit team expected to find processes in place to add and remove access, password, sign-on controls, and unique user ids to ensure that inventory system access is controlled."
passwords are required to log in.
the responsibility for adding and removing user access is known and restricted to three (3) administrators.
"lastly, an operating manual of intelevent that provides information on how to fully operate the system is available."
assets controls capital celebrations and program operations directorate assets are kept in secure location with controlled access and are periodically inspected and counted.
ccpod assets are essential to the delivery of ce activities and represent a significant investment for the department.
the directive for the management of moveable assets requires that physical security and safekeeping of all moveable assets is established and that physical verification and monitoring of assets are being performed.
"the audit team expected to find that ccpod assets were kept in a secure location with controlled access, periodically inspected and counted."
the physical security of the warehouse is managed by pch security; access is only granted upon ccpod manager-s approval and validation of security clearance.
access to the warehouse is removed by pch security once notified by ccpod management or receiving employee-s departure form.
pch security also conducts an access reconfirmation procedure every three months to ensure given access is updated.
"to identify anomalies and missing assets, ccpod also conducts annual inventory count."
the count is performed by an external firm and by ccpod employees; the results from both counts are compared to identify anomalies.
"through document review, auditors found that the last inventory count was performed in october 2015."
"in addition, under the rlp, there is a formal process for reception of returned assets."
"upon return of assets from each client, a visual inspection is performed by a ce warehouse employee, who documents any damage and missing assets."
"for other heavy/lifting equipment, inspection and maintenance is performed on an annual basis."
monitoring use of rented assets capital celebrations and program operations directorate has a process to adequately prevent misuse of rented assets.
ccpod assets can be rented by not-for-profit associations and government agencies for the festivals or events being held within the ncr unless required by pch.
"punitive and preventive measures for the misuse of these rented assets through instruments such as clauses, insurances, should be in place to adequately safeguard and monitor the use of rented assets."
the client must also sign the agreement to accept the terms and conditions and provide the deposit and proof of insurance before being able to rent the equipment.
the audit team also examined 46 loan of equipment agreement files and found that clauses to safeguard the department-s interests are included in every agreement as required.
"in addition to the loan of equipment agreement, the audit team confirms that the rlp prevents misuse of its assets by communicating with the clients and responding to information requests."
evidence was also provided that ccpod employees communicate with the clients to ensure understanding of terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for the rlp.
"issues on misuse, damaged, missing or disposable items and any depreciation should be reported to management, but such events have yet to occur or be reported."
"in addition, access and inventory controls are in place and operating to secure assets."
improvements should be made to ensure communication and compliance to relevant policies.
appendix a - audit criteria the conclusions reached for each of the audit criteria used in the audit were developed according to the following definitions.
numerical categorization
the findings are based on a combination of the evidence gathered through the audit methodology for each audit criterion.
"findings of lesser materiality, risk or impact have been communicated with the auditee either verbally or in a management letter."
"through interviews and document review, the audit team found that ccpod directions, objectives and mandate are clearly defined at the branch level."
"the audit team found that expected results, performance indicators, targets and actual results are effectively monitored and reported."
risk management compliance with the policy on management and use of assets capital celebrations and program operations directorate is not fully compliant with relevant asset management policies and directives.
the audit team found that ccpod does not have a life cycle management plan in place.
such a plan for the assets did not exist at the time of the transfer to pch and was the result of decisions made prior to the transfer.
"without a life cycle management plan, there is a risk of inefficient and/or reactive management of assets from requirements to disposal and replacement."
assets management framework capital celebrations and program operations directorate does not have an assets management framework in place that reflects an integrated approach to risk management.
"as per the policy of management of materiel, the basis for the pch directive on the management of moveable assets, an asset management framework should be in place that reflects an integrated approach to risk management; provides relevant performance information; sets out clear accountability and decision-making regimes that are consistent with organizational resources and capacity; and supports timely, informed asset management decisions and the strategic outcomes of departmental programs."
"as part of this approach, risks related to ccpod assets should be identified, assessed, prioritized, mitigated, monitored and reported."
"the audit team found that ccpod did not have an asset management framework in place, including risk management mechanisms/tools pertaining to ccpod inventory."
the current practice is to mitigate emerging issues and risks on a reactive basis.
"without an asset management framework, there is a risk that management would not make timely and informed materiel management decisions consistent with organizational resources and capacity; and this would have an impact on program delivery."
the audit team found that intelevent is the only inventory system used by ccpod and access to the system is only granted to ccpod-s production services employees.
"through interviews with ccpod management and employees, system walkthrough and inquiries with pch chief information officer branch (ciob), the audit team found that access to the system is only permitted when an employee is provided with a unique id with the approval from the ccpod manager and working with a pch workstation that has intelevent software license installed within pch network."
"in addition, the audit team found that access to privileged user accounts is restricted."
individual access rights within the system are also appropriate with work responsibilities.
the audit team concludes that the capital celebrations and program operations directorate has appropriate access controls and processes in place and operating to secure assets.
the audit team concludes that the capital celebrations and program operations directorate has appropriate structures and processes in place and operating to secure assets.

"to support management in exercising additional due diligence, the oae conducted an independent, multi-phase audit of goods and services billed to pwgsc by six companies through various contracts and call-ups against standing offers for the period of april 1, 2008 to april 1, 2011."
the objective was to determine whether goods and services billed to pwgsc by the six companies were accurate and supported.
"more information on the audit objective, scope, approach and criteria can be found in the section -about the audit- at the end of the report."
"statement of conformance the audit conforms with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
the findings and conclusion are only applicable to the entity examined and for the scope and time period covered by the audit.
"scope limitations while conducting the audit of six firms, the oae encountered several obstacles which limited the ability to provide assurance on the accuracy and supportability of all expenditures selected for testing as follows: financial audit trail limitations to assess billings to pwgsc, the oae required a listing of all payments made to the six firms for the period under audit."
"sigma is pwgsc-s financial reporting system, and it contains information related to all payments made by the department."
"for a contractor to be paid, they must have a vendor identification number in the system."
"when an invoice is to be paid, the user is required to input relevant information such as the departmental cost center, payment type, vendor identification number, and any relevant invoice and contractual data to support the payment."
this information serves as an audit trail to allow the tracing of a payment back to the procurement to which it is related.
this was eventually resolved with the identification of the multiple vender codes and revised payment listings for these multiple codes were prepared.
we also found a variety of user input errors in the sigma generated financial reports.
"for example, in some cases, the contract number and contract type were inaccurate."
we encourage the real property branch and finance and administration branch to assess whether the current control environment would mitigate these issues.
the authority for these audits was derived from these clauses.
pwgsc-s standard acquisitions clauses and conditions manual contains a standard audit clause for all contracts.
this clause states that amounts claimed under the contracts are subject to government audit both before and after payments are made.
"in addition, the contractor must keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the work and keep all documents relating to such costs for six years after it receives final payment under the contract."
"this gives pwgsc the ability to initiate an audit, within the stated timeframe, to assess whether payments made under the contract were supported."
"in others, the length of time for which the clause was valid had been reduced to less than six years."
"this issue was raised to the attention of the assistant deputy minister, acquisitions branch in may of 2014 and a notification was sent to all acquisitions branch staff reminding them of the importance of audit clauses."
"the notification also informed staff that removal of the clauses must be approved by the assistant deputy minister, acquisitions branch."
"missing or incomplete contract files to ensure that amounts billed to pwgsc were accurate and supportable, the oae carried out procedures to trace a sample of payments made by the department to the related invoices and contractual documentation."
"this documentation included the contract, the company proposal, any amendments to contract and proposal, timesheets, receipts for disbursements, and deliverables."
"in an attempt to address this gap, the oae contacted each company and requested that it provide supporting documentation related to the selected invoices it had sent to pwgsc."
firms 2 and 3 were very cooperative and provided the oae with significant documentation.
"due to missing or incomplete procurement files, the oae was limited in concluding on whether all selected amounts billed were supported for all firms."
audit of firm 1 firm 1 is a small canadian engineering consulting company.
"during the specified audit timeframe, 14 payments were made to the company totaling approximately $165,000."
"when the oae initiated its audit, it identified that the audit clauses in the contracts related to payments made to firm 1 had been reduced to two years or removed completely."
"as the oae-s audit was only initiated in 2013, the department-s right to audit firm 1 had expired."
"this sample totaled approximately $2,400,000 in payments from the audit scope period of april 1, 2008 to april 1, 2011."
"of this amount, $248,285 resulted from invoices that lacked the detail necessary to identify a specific individual."
"for example, a position such as project manager was provided instead of the specific individual-s name, or no detail was provided and the invoice only contained a total billable amount."
"this sampling totaled approximately $3,200,000 in payments from the audit scope period of april 1, 2008 to april 1, 2011."
"of this amount, $226,681 resulted from invoices that lacked the detail necessary to identify a specific individual by name."
"conclusions the oae was able to assess two of the six companies, firms 2 and 3."
"for these reasons, the oae has concluded that the expenditures examined for firm 2 and firm 3 were generally accurate and supportable."
"testing related to the last three companies; firms 4, 5 and 6 was suspended as a result of systemic billing irregularities noted during the examination phase. at the request of the real property branch, the results of the audit work completed to date and related files were transferred to the departmental oversight branch for additional work that is outside the mandate of the engagement as communicated to the firms at the launch of the audit."
"overall, the oae encountered a number of scope limitations that presented significant challenges and delays in conducting the audit."
"the primary issues were audit trail limitations, missing or modified audit clauses in the contracts, and missing documentation. in some instances, these challenges limited the ability of the oae to provide reasonable assurance on the selected expenditures to be examined."
"management response real property branch and finance branch have had an opportunity to review the report, and agreed with the observations and conclusions made at the time of the audit."
sufficient and appropriate audit procedures have been conducted and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the findings and conclusions in this report and to provide an audit level of assurance.
the findings and conclusions are based on the results of specified procedures conducted by the audit team.
we found that multiple vendor identification numbers (-vendor codes-) existed for three of the six companies.
"as a result, the oae did not initially have a complete listing of all payments made to the vendors."
"the lack of completeness of payments came to our attention when two vendors, who were cooperative, provided us with invoices for which we had no record of payment."
"in other cases, the contract/payment amount differed in the financial system from what was indicated on the original contract document."
"although the oae encountered challenges related to the audit trail for the procure to pay process, an assessment of controls was not within the scope of the audit."
"in addition, the audit timeframe (2008 to 2011) may not represent the current state of the control environment."
"contract audit clauses missing or inconsistent to ensure that the best value is received by the crown, pwgsc contracts include a right to audit clause which provides the department with the means to verify that payments are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract."
we found that in some cases the audit clause had been removed from contracts.
"for example, in some cases we found this clause had been modified to limit the timeframe to two years after the last payment under the contract."
"however, some of these contracts were issued under the delegated authority of officials in the real property branch."
"although the period under audit was 2008-2011, we encourage the assistant deputy minister, real property branch to consider whether preventative actions should be taken to prevent this issue in future in the real property branch."
we found a significant number of procurement records that should have been in the possession of pwgsc could not be located within the department.
sufficient documentation was available for firms 5 and 6.
"we found $280,610 of billings related to individual hourly billings that could not be traced to supporting documents."
"this included disbursements claimed by the companies that required supporting receipts, as well as expenses that were determined to be ineligible based on the contract terms and conditions."
"similar to the above, we were unable to determine if the supporting receipts, or approval for expenses not specified in the contract had been initially received by pwgsc and later misplaced, or if they were unsupported. from the tested sample, we found $1,221 in mathematical errors. these were primarily the result of incorrectly applying gst and provincial sales taxes on invoiced amounts. although we identified calculation errors and unsupported amounts claimed, we did not find any evidence of inherent concerns and in many cases, the billing irregularities noted were the result of incomplete supporting documentation. in addition, section 34 of the faa had been appropriately authorized for most of the payments made to firm 2, indicating acceptance by the department that the billings were appropriate. as such, the real property branch concluded that no reasonable grounds exist to secure payment after the fact. audit of firm 3 firm 3 is a large canadian environmental engineering company. using a risk based sampling approach, the oae selected a judgemental sample of 325 out of 795 total payments to the firm."
"we found $347,968 of billings related to individual hourly billings that could not be traced to supporting documents."
"similar to above, we were unable to determine if the supporting receipts, or approval for expenses not specified in the contract had been initially received by pwgsc and later misplaced, or if they were unsupported. from the tested sample, we found $552 in mathematical errors. these were primarily the result of incorrectly applying gst and provincial sales taxes on invoiced amounts. although in some cases we found mathematical errors and unsupported amounts claimed, we did not find any evidence of inherent concerns and in many cases, the billing irregularities noted were the result of incomplete supporting documentation. in addition, section 34 of the faa had been appropriately authorized for most of the payments made to firm 3, indicating acceptance by the department that the billings were appropriate. as such, the real property branch concluded that no reasonable grounds exist to secure payment after the fact. audit of firms 4, 5, and 6 testing related to the last three companies; firm 4, firm 5 and firm 6 was suspended as a result of systemic billing irregularities noted during the examination phase. at the request of the real property branch, the results of the audit work completed to date and the related files were transferred to the departmental oversight branch for additional work that is outside the mandate of the engagement as communicated to the firms at the launch of the audit."
"for those expenditures tested, there was no evidence of inherent concerns with the examined billings and section 34 of the faa had been appropriately authorized for most of the transactions in the sampled procurement files."
"as such, the real property branch concluded that no reasonable grounds exist to secure payment after the fact. the oae was unable to conclude on the remaining four of the six companies."
"however, these financial audit trail limitations (control weaknesses) have been addressed by the implementation of corrective measures subsequent to the period under audit."

"april 2016 july 31, 2016 dg fprm for sms training: director general, financial operations and administrative services (dg fas) program accountable executives, who are having difficulty recruiting, should conduct appropriate analysis as part of their hr planning to develop sustainable recruitment strategies."
"as part of the new direction in staffing, hr will update its oversight model with a focus on measuring outcomes (e.g.: efficiency, quality of hire), and will focus monitoring on tc-s context and risks, resulting in reducing the reporting burden."
"there is no documented program design framework to validate that new and modified activities comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and treasury board policy requirements, and to consult with primary stakeholders."
"(criteria 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 24, 27, 34) the cihr programs and initiatives under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions reflect a broad range of attributes."
"they range from low dollar-value, one-time targeted awards to high-value, multi-partner, long-term commitments that establish enabling structures for research."
"using an umbrella set of terms & conditions to encompass this wide range of initiatives provides flexibility, but can add complexity to the design and development of those initiatives."
treasury board policy requires that program managers assess a set of core design elements and document evidence of their consideration when designing or redesigning a transfer payment program.
this is usually addressed through the development and approval process for the program terms & conditions.
"as a result, there are core design elements that should be considered or at a minimum validated during the design and development of new initiatives."
"cihr-s program suite can be grouped into three broad categories: operating support, career support (both under the investigator initiated area) and priority driven."
"the first two categories generally comprise initiatives that are (or will be) repeated on a regular basis, for example the project and foundation schemes and cihr fellowships."
"priority driven initiatives are heterogeneous, encompassing a variety of activities and include those under the purview of the institutes."
in reviewing a sample of programs and funding opportunities the following gaps were identified: grants were awarded to organizational recipients not identified in the current terms & conditions.
some grant funds were redistributed by the initial recipients as awards.
some recipients were paid in advance of meeting eligibility requirements.
grants were awarded that may have provided benefits to other federal departments.
"initiatives must comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions, the treasury board policies on which the terms & conditions are based and applicable tri-agency and internal policies."
"despite the differences in the initiatives, they follow a similar development cycle."
"initial activities include strategy setting, requirements definition and initiative planning, followed by design, launch and management of the competition."
"ongoing payments and other supporting activities comprise post-award administration, and depending on the program, a decision to continue, transition or end the initiative may be required."
this is necessary to confirm that recipients and activities are eligible under the terms & conditions.
"for example, budget profiling on large, longer-term grants such as those in the priority driven and foundation programs could alleviate the need to review and consider holdbacks later on."
"some programs run for a designated length of time while others will require a decision to continue, transition or end."
"as noted above, the use of umbrella terms & conditions provides flexibility, but adds complexity to the design and development of initiatives."
"in addition, cihr collaborates with its partner funding agencies, sshrc and nserc and to a lesser degree, cfi, on the development of common policies and guidelines related to the conduct of research and the administration of funding."
"the use of two different agreement templates, the common account and the separate funding agreement, adds another dimension."
"in summary, the requirements and obligations of funding recipients are documented in a variety of places and the actual location varies slightly depending on the following factors: if there is a published funding opportunity; if the payment is through a common account or direct payment; if there is a separate funding agreement; and which cihr and tri-agency policies are linked to from the funding opportunity and agreements."
tracking how the various obligations are addressed under different circumstances would assist program staff in the development of initiatives and impact assessment of policy changes.
identification of and review by all offices of primary interest at the right time in the development lifecycle will ensure that any issues are identified and addressed early on.
"establish a program design and development framework that identifies key approval points and required supporting documentation, and includes representation from offices of primary interest."
"responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed rkte has recently completed a lean process review of all of its priority-driven competitions and will now add a new step into the process to review the tb policy on transfer payments and the terms & conditions prior to the development of funding opportunities."
this step will ensure compliance with the recommendation.
expected completion january 2017.
these institutions undergo a review process prior to being granted status to administer cihr funds and are subject to ongoing oversight of their financial administration controls through the financial monitoring process.
"cihr is considered a small organization in terms of number of full time employees (402), but manages a large funding budget (nearly $1billion)."
"as such, the governance strategy for major initiatives will be modified to ensure a consistent level of detail is captured for all major initiatives."
"(criteria 2, 16, 31, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) as described in observation #2 above, many grants are paid via common accounts at eligible institutions, which are subject to ongoing oversight through the financial monitoring process."
"while direct payments represented only 4% ($27.9m) of the total payments made under the research projects and personnel support in fiscal year 2014-15, a small number of them are large value."
"in some cases, separate funding agreements have been established with grant recipients paid through common accounts."
"(criteria 30, 34, 35, 40, 41) financial reporting by recipients provides input into several processes, including recovery of unspent balances, requests for extensions to grants, and assessment of cash flow requirements."
"these address requirements defined by treasury board, cihr and tri-agency policies and guidelines, and the controls required for proper management and reporting of government resources."
the cihr grants and awards guide and the tri-agency financial administration guide specify that unspent balances at the end of a grant are to be returned to the crown.
accurate and timely reporting on the use of grant funds is required to support these processes.
"for the majority of grants, reporting on the use of funds occurs via the grants in aid of research statement of account, commonly referred to as the form 300."
"these reports are submitted annually, either electronically via the financial data submissions and reconciliation (fdsr) system or on paper."
"the data is then uploaded to eis, the cihr system that tracks information related to grants and payments."
paper submissions are directly entered into eis by cihr staff.
the form 300 process is labour-intensive and requires manual intervention to reconcile the amounts reported with eis.
the form 300s are primarily used to identify unspent balances to be recovered once the authorization for funding has expired.
"due to the gaps in the information on outstanding balances, amounts that are due to the crown are difficult to accurately estimate."
timing is also an issue; the form 300s are due by the end of june for the previous fiscal year and require additional time for reconciliation.
"as such, the information is not available until well after year end and has limited use in informing decisions on payments for the current year."
there are challenges to improving the process.
"unspent balances may result for several reasons, including delays in ethics approvals, approved leaves for researchers and the cihr internal budgeting processes."
"as per the standard government process, cihr is allocated budget for grants one year at a time and must spend the majority of the money within that year."
"analysis on a sample of available information indicates that larger, longer-term grants tend to carry larger annual balances and are more likely to be extended beyond their original expiry date."
(criterion 1c) the governing council (gc) of cihr is responsible for establishing policies respecting -consulting and collaborating with persons and organization that have an interest in health research.- this responsibility is assigned to gc in the cihr act.
"such a policy would enable gc to clearly outline their expectations for and the general principles to be applied to partnerships, collaborations and consultations."
"a documented policy on consulting and collaborating that is periodically reviewed and updated would establish clear expectations, roles and responsibilities for partnering, consulting and collaboration, and ensure that practices are in line with the principles and strategic direction for the agency established and approved by governing council."
governing council should establish a policy on partnerships that enumerates its expectations with regards to collaborating and consulting with external stakeholders.
"responsibility vice-president external affairs and business development action agreed the vice president, external affairs and business development (eabd), will recommend to the president that he request that governing council formally delegate responsibility for developing a policy regarding -consulting and collaborating- to the vice president, external affairs and business development if this delegation of authority is approved by governing council, the vice president, eabd, will commit to providing gc with an annual report on the progress made and results achieved related to the implementation of two corporate strategies : cihr stakeholder engagement strategy; cihr partnerships strategy expected completion: spring 2017 service standards for funding programs have not been established as per the requirement defined in the policy on transfer payments."
(criterion 25).
the treasury board policy on transfer payments requires reasonable and practical department service standards be established for transfer payments.
further guidance on what these standards should include is not provided.
the 2012 audit of grant and contribution program reforms by the office of the auditor general highlighted the following areas that two organizations had addressed: acknowledgement of application; timelines to provide funding decisions to applicants; time it takes to issue payments.
a brief survey of published service standards information from other organizations considered comparable to cihr with respect to the type of funding offered found a wide variety in the type and level of service standards.
cihr publishes formal service standards for electronic systems that address researchnet and the impact of unplanned interruptions on extensions to funding opportunity deadlines.
"in addition, each funding opportunity contains a schedule that includes the application deadline, the anticipated notice of decision and the funding start date."
"the contact centre is the central focus point for interactions with cihr by applicants, recipients and other stakeholders and is tasked with developing service standards."
the use of the newly implemented customer relationship management system should facilitate tracking and reporting of response times for certain operations.
"establishing and publishing reasonable and practical service standards would help manage client expectations, assist staff responsible for responding to prioritize their work and establish a baseline for performance measurement."
a) establish and publish a set of reasonable and practical service standards for transfer payments interactions with applicants and recipients.
"b) implement a performance measurement strategy to identify, collect and report on metrics for service standards."
"a) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed cihr-s contact centre was established in july of 2015 and is responsible for managing all inquiries from applicants and grant recipients in order to provide consistent, coordinated and integrated service delivery."
service standards are being developed and implemented over the coming months.
"expected completion: april 2017 b) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed a performance measurement strategy will be developed to identify, collect and report on the metrics for the service standards implemented (6a)."
expected completion: april 2017 the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies require updating to reflect cihr-s current business model and ensure consistency in terminology between documents.
"(criteria 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22) the terms & conditions are the vehicle by which treasury board grants authority to cihr to distribute funding under the research projects and personnel support program."
they document how cihr addresses key aspects of the treasury board transfer payment policy requirements and outline the general structure for the program.
"internal policies, directives and processes should support and align with the terms & conditions, providing staff with clear guidance on the design and delivery of initiatives under the terms & conditions."
"the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions were last reviewed in 2011, when ministerial approval was obtained for minor updates."
"prior to that, the last major update was in november 2006."
the areas requiring review and update in the terms & conditions are: remove the -governance- section which is not required and is inaccurate; update the -class of recipients- section to reflect the changing nature of cihr-s programs as endorsed by governing council; revise the -collaboration (grants)- sub-section under the -funding types- section to reflect current funding for research enabling structures.
"consideration should be given to writing these sections as generically as possible, to avoid them becoming outdated if supporting elements change."
"the following items require review for clarification or interpretation to ensure there is consistency between the terms & conditions, the grants and awards guide and how they are used in funding opportunities."
ensure clarity and consistency in the definitions of knowledge users.
"the terms & conditions read that knowledge users must be affiliated with a post-secondary or research institution, but the grants and awards guide definition is broader, allowing knowledge users from private enterprises or media outlets."
the term -eligible institution- in the grants and awards guide refers to one that has been approved to administer cihr research funds.
staff developing funding opportunities should be clear on their intent when using the term eligible institution.
updating the terms & conditions to better align with current business models at cihr will ensure that approved authorities are clear and not overstepped.
"review and update the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies, guidelines and procedures to reflect current practice and ensure that terminology and definitions are clear and consistent between documents."
responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be the primary point of contact with tbs to ensure that the updates to the t&cs are reflective of program needs and tbs guidelines.
vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will coordinate the stakeholders- input in the revision.
the tri-agency agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards signed with each eligible institution applies to grants paid through common accounts.
the cihr funding agreement template is the basis for agreements signed with direct payment recipients and others where additional terms are required.
"the following items are missing from the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards an indemnification clause to the benefit of the crown as per requirement 8 of the directive, appendix f a clause indicating funds are subject to appropriation as per requirement #6 of the directive, appendix f."
"this clause appears in the funding opportunity template and on the authorization for funding form, but consideration should be given to adding it to the standard agreement a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f the following items are missing from the funding agreement template."
"a clause regarding termination or reduction of funding if the recipient no longer meets eligibility requirements as per requirement #7 of the directive, appendix f a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f."
"the current template includes a clause covering the values & ethics code, but not all aspects of the requirement are addressed."
missing elements may result in exposure to cihr through increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders.
review and update the funding agreement templates to accurately reflect the requirements specified in appendix f of the directive on transfer payments.
"responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed the senior corporate advisor, in consultation with the deputy chief financial officer, will revise the funding agreement template to ensure full compliance with appendix f."
"expected completion: march 2017 during the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could strengthen systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to transfer payments."
these have been communicated to management.
appendix audit criteria the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that delivery of programs under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions is well-controlled.
criteria reference to observations
funding opportunities were published and included individual recipients inconsistent with the current terms & conditions.
there are also activities that could be incorporated into the early planning that would assist with addressing policy requirements post-award.
"incorporating a risk-based approach (as described in observation #3) early on in the process would enable staff to shape the design, development and proposed oversight activities accordingly, focusing on the higher risk areas."
"involvement of the appropriate offices of primary interest (such as finance and legal) based on the nature and risk of the initiative, would assist in identifying and addressing potential issues early on in the development cycle."
this decision should be based on a review or assessment of how the program has achieved its stated objectives.
lack of clarity on if and where policy obligations are addressed could result in misunderstanding or obligations not being properly identified or understood.
there is no integrated approach to risk assessment and ongoing risk management of both initiatives and recipients as required by treasury board policy and directive on transfer payments.
"(criteria 3, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) treasury board revised its transfer payment policy suite in 2008 based on a set of recommendations issued by an independent blue ribbon panel that reviewed grants and contributions programs across government."
one of the cornerstones of the revised policy suite is the requirement for a risk-based approach to the design of programs and the determination of requirements for recipient monitoring and oversight.
risks are assessed at different levels within cihr.
the corporate risk profile identifies the top risks that could threaten the ability of cihr to achieve its overall objectives.
"for some programs and initiatives, risks are identified through the treasury board submission process when applicable, and through the governance strategies for major initiatives."
"within priority driven research, there are gaps in existing risk management processes at the program and initiative level."
"risks and mitigating strategies are identified and documented in treasury board submissions for those programs that require one, but there is no monitoring or reassessment of these risks to determine their continued applicability."
"while governance strategies for major initiatives do identify risks and mitigating strategies the strategies reviewed took different approaches, with some identifying risks at high-level, others in detail and some moving directly to mitigation strategies."
"for investigator initiated research, project risks were identified and assessed and mitigation strategies put in place as part of the reforms to the open programs, but the new business processes for the project and foundation scheme do not include assessment of program or recipient risks."
"the proposal to implement a case management approach for the foundation grants represents a risk mitigation strategy, but is not based on a formal risk assessment."
establishing consistent criteria for identifying and assessing risk across program areas and within specific initiatives would enable a more complete view of overall program risks and allow oversight bodies and resources to focus on risk mitigation and monitoring in the areas where it is most needed.
"resource constraints combined with the fact that all programs relate to funding and directly support the cihr mandate and strategic objectives suggest an integrated approach to program and risk assessment could be beneficial, providing senior management with a more complete view of the key risks facing the organization in achieving its objectives."
ongoing monitoring of risk and the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies is equally important as the initial identification and assessment of risk.
"risk and impact managing enterprise and program risk in a non-integrated fashion may result in key risks not being identified, prioritized and managed. a consistent approach to risk assessment and ongoing monitoring of program and initiative risks would ensure resources are focused in the areas where they are most needed."
establish an integrated and consistent approach to initial risk assessment and ongoing risk management for programs and initiatives under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions.
"responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: partially agreed although major initiatives all involve a governance strategy with a risk assessment, the level of detail is not always consistent."
"as a result, initiatives that are found to be of higher risk will have ongoing senior management monitoring."
"over the next year, cihr will be implementing enterprise risk management and as part of its planning and implementation, cihr will assess the impact and capacity to do risk management from a recipient perspective."
"the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions specify that while the majority of research funds are paid to eligible institutions, funds may be paid directly to recipients when cihr has determined that a direct payment represents an acceptable risk; however, there is no formal process for the risk assessment."
"in addition, while the treasury board directive on transfer payments allows for grants to be paid without a formal agreement, the grant must be both low risk and low materiality."
cihr has not defined thresholds for these conditions nor assigned responsibility for assessment.
direct payment recipients are not included in the financial monitoring process and there is no comparable process to assess the risks related to these recipients- use of the funds.
establishing thresholds and criteria for risk rating of these direct payment grants and awards would allow the oversight to be appropriately tailored.
"although related to recipient risk, this aspect should also be considered in the assessment of program risk discussed in observation #2, as the nature and objectives of the program will also influence the need for an agreement."
"the treasury board directive on transfer payments establishes requirements for cash management, including aligning payments to recipient cash flow requirements and holdbacks on payments when there is a risk of overpayment or lack of performance."
these risks should be considered as part of determining oversight requirements and to identify when it is appropriate to profile grant payments to better match funding needs.
"for example, the current default is to pay out all grants in equal installments over the lifetime of the funding; however for larger, long-term grants, installment payments could be more closely aligned with the recipients- cash flow requirements."
risk and impact the treasury board policy and directive on transfer payment requires managers of transfer payment programs to apply oversight and administrative requirements to recipients based on an assessment of risk.
"without a consistent and structured process to assess the risk of recipients or classes of recipients, cihr is not in compliance with this policy."
"responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be defining, documenting and implementing a risk based approach on: definitions on what is considered high versus low risk consistent use of agreements as a mitigation strategy establishing appropriate payment schedules and cash management as deemed necessary based on risk definition (see observation 4) expected completion: march 2017 recipient financial reporting is not always received in a timely fashion, constraining cihr-s ability to meet the cash management requirements as defined in the directive on transfer payments."
"the directive on transfer payments states that payment of grant installments should be aligned with recipient cash flow requirements, that funding should reflect the minimum amount required to achieve the objectives and that holdbacks be considered when appropriate."
direct payment recipients are not actively reviewed as part of the current form 300 reporting and reconciliation process.
"cihr administers thousands of grants that vary in both value and length, which means that while the aggregate unspent balances at eligible institutions may be significant, assessing each individual grant may not be feasible."
"despite these challenges, there is sufficient information available with the current process to identify higher-risk grants and focus reporting and analysis efforts on these."
"risk and impact without accurate and timely financial reporting, cihr does not have the information required to fully comply with the cash management requirements of the directive on transfer payments and to ensure government resources are prudently managed. a) review the current form 300 reporting process to determine if improvements can be made to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of reporting on use of grant funds and to leverage information for decision making."
"b) apply a risk-based approach to identify and define the information required to ensure funding levels are appropriate, payments are aligned with recipient cash flow requirements, and to identify and record debts to the crown."
"a) responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be reviewing the form 300 process based on risk to: evaluate the scope, accuracy and timing of the review; ensure proper follow up process; improve reporting for decision making."
"expected completion: march 2017 b) responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be defining, documenting and implementing a revised cash management process by: reviewing payment schedules; increasing follow-ups on recipients cash flow and amount owed to the crown; recording debts to the crown based on best estimate at reporting date."
"although gc has communicated its support for partnerships and collaboration, it has not established a policy with respect to consultation and collaboration, nor has it formally delegated this responsibility."
"while cihr has established the organization and other supporting structures that enable the agency to enter into agreements with various parties for the purpose of achieving its objectives, a policy on consulting and collaborating does not exist."
risk and impact the lack of an approved policy on consulting and collaborating is not in compliance with cihr act.
"although the terms & conditions are generally in compliance with treasury board policy, a set of minor amendments are recommended to bring them up to date, add clarity and better align with the types of initiatives cihr currently undertakes."
minor discrepancies between the terms & conditions and supporting documents were also identified; these should be reviewed and updates made to the appropriate document to ensure alignment.
"clearly define the projects, initiatives and activities and separate them from the eligible recipients; the stacking provision section contains contradictory language and does not reflect the current actions taken by cihr nor the increasing significance of partner funding; update the basis and timing of payment and the performance measurement strategy to reflect the current practices."
"which documents require updating will depend on the outcome of the review; however, a general principle is to keep the definitions broad in the terms & conditions, and include any restrictions in lower level documents, such as the grants and awards guide or the funding opportunity."
"the terms & conditions do not use this term; however, there is language regarding the type of institution with which recipients must be affiliated which can be referred to as an eligible institution."
"risk and impact the terms & conditions represent cihr-s commitment to treasury board on how the research projects and personnel support program will operate, who will receive funding and for what activities."
"expected completion: march 2018 the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards and the cihr funding agreement template are not fully compliant with the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 7, 8) the treasury board directive on transfer payments lays out the clauses that must be included in the funding agreement for a grant."
funding agreements are based on two templates.
"a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f a clause notifying the recipient regarding public dissemination of information regarding the recipient and the grant as per requirement #14 of the directive, appendix f the terms & conditions include requirements for official languages as such, a clause should be included in the template for consideration when appropriate as per requirement #16 of the directive, appendix f the information to be obtained for confirmation of ongoing eligibility, if required as per requirement #17 of the directive, appendix f a clause regarding any obligations for an environmental assessment as per requirement #24 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration as it is a requirement in regular fos. a clause regarding privacy and personal information as per requirement #25 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration."
the tri-agency framework: responsible conduct of research addresses this extensively and could be included through reference.
"risk and impact without all of the required elements, the research projects and personnel support program is not fully compliant with the treasury board directive on transfer payments."
required elements for funding agreements are defined to ensure funding agreements minimize risks to cihr and enable programs to achieve their objectives.

communication to hr - september 2016 december 2017
through the deputy minister-s initial budget delegation it will be indicated that the sms will be the only system used to manage and forecast salaries throughout the fiscal year. any other source will not be recognized.
"april 2016 july 31, 2016 dg fprm for sms training: director general, financial operations and administrative services (dg fas) program accountable executives, who are having difficulty recruiting, should conduct appropriate analysis as part of their hr planning to develop sustainable recruitment strategies."
"as part of the new direction in staffing, hr will update its oversight model with a focus on measuring outcomes (e.g.: efficiency, quality of hire), and will focus monitoring on tc-s context and risks, resulting in reducing the reporting burden."
"management responses are included and provide: an action plan to address each recommendation a lead responsible for implementing the action plan, and, a target date for completing the action plan."
promotion processes for research scientists application process there is an annual application process for the promotion of research scientists which commences in october and is completed by april of the following year.
"at the initiation of the promotion process a -call- letter is sent out to all research scientists, which provides links to the federal career progression management framework, aafc application form and guidelines, the balanced evaluation guide and career progression rating reports, and a -preparing your promotion- powerpoint deck."
"the -call- letter encouraged applicants to seek advice, comments, and feedback from colleagues and their research, development and technology director."
"the audit interviewed a sample of 24 research scientists, representing 24% of the 98 who applied for a promotion in 2012-13 and 2013-14. half of the sample were successful and the other half non-successful."
feedback from interviewees found that the -call- letter and sharepoint site information was helpful to applicants.
the audit reviewed the departmental career progression review committee meeting minutes for 2013-14 and 2014-15 and found that the committee held post mortems on how to improve the promotion process from year to year.
"interviews with research scientists also showed that a majority of them: 22 of 24 (92%), used informal means to have colleagues provide comments and feedback on their application, prior to submission."
"assessment of applications stb manages the application process of the career progression management framework for federal researches through five committees: four res-level career progression committees (res 01-02, res 02-03, res 03-04 and res 04-05) responsible for evaluating and recommending or denying applications for promotion and consideration to the departmental committee; the departmental career progression review committee (dcprc) is the highest level committee, which determines final approval or denial."
the chair of the dcprc issues a letter of decision to each applicant.
"valued outcomes were assessed on the three contexts of work: research, development and analysis, managing of research and representation of client services."
"during the audit conduct, a terms of reference was finalized for the departmental career progression review committee (dcprc) which included its mandate and defined roles and responsibilities."
"recommendation 1: the adm, science and technology branch should ensure that terms of references are developed, approved for all the committees overseeing the promotional processes for research scientists and made available on the stb site, including such aspects as: how committee member selection is designed to cover different applicants- areas of research; and how conflict of interest situations are managed."
management response and action plan: agreed. stb is in the process of developing terms of reference for all career progression committees and updating the terms of reference for the departmental committee.
"these will address among other issues the selection of committee members, including consideration of area of scientific specialization, and conflicts of interest, and will be posted on the sharepoint site advertised and accessible to all branch staff."
decision letters encouraged the unsuccessful applicants to discuss results with chairs for further explanation.
"management response and action plan: agreed. stb will improve the quality and timeliness of this feedback, including providing all applicants with the option of a meeting with the chair of the relevant career progression committee to discuss their application."
lessons learned from these applications will also be used to improve the frequently asked questions sharepoint site.
applicants will also be given the opportunity each year to provide feedback on the process as a whole including the quality and timeliness of comments on their application through a survey to be conducted each year within two months of the conclusion of the annual exercise; this feedback will be made available to the committee chairs for continuous improvement.
the irm is overseen by the corporate management branch - human resources directorate.
the audit determined that five se-res applied for recourse during 2012-13 and 2013-14.
"in the latter case, an aafc in-depth reviewer was assigned and verified as independent to the applicant."
"the audit also verified that aafc performed the independent recourse process steps in a timely manner, and as defined in the irm."
succession planning for research scientists the audit team examined current succession planning processes in relation to treasury board of canada secretariat-s guidance and good business practices.
"this included such elements as: identification of key positions, definition of capabilities required, recruitment options, monitoring activities, governance mechanism and roles and responsibilities."
this analysis is provided to stb senior management to support the development of the annual staffing plan.
"the audit highlighted the need to have a strategic perspective and mechanisms in place for se-res positions at the national, sectoral, and centre levels; and to identify key areas for succession early, in order to ensure continuity of research and knowledge transfer."
aafc is working with the deans of the agriculture universities and colleges on succession planning and prioritizing and aligning capacity for new positions to meet future research needs.
"in addition, aafc is working with the sector to determine the public-private research staffing requirements."
"by including this, it would reinforce the importance of succession planning at the committee level, and enable a periodic discussion on succession planning by the committee."
"recommendation 3: the adm, science and technology branch should review and strengthen the management control framework for succession planning of research scientists, including: identify key positions for succession planning; enhance research, development and technology management guidance documents and/or tools for succession planning; and revise the terms of references for key branch committees to include succession planning as an area of responsibility."
management response and action plan: agreed.
"as identified as a need by our hr tiger team, stb is developing a talent management process specifically focused on the se-res community."
other classifications will also be addressed.
"in order to identify these key positions, stb will perform demographic and scientific specialization analyses of key positions."
this analysis will be presented and discussed at the branch implementation and human resources committee and the branch executive committee at least annually.
a document will be developed and presented to the branch implementation and human resources committee providing guidance on scientist succession planning.
the terms of reference of the branch implementation and human resources committee will be revised to explicitly include scientist succession planning.
"target date for completion: september 30, 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, science and technology branch annex a: audit criteria a) promotion of research scientists: to determine whether the career progression process for research scientists is in place and followed as per the career progression management framework for federal researchers."
to determine whether there are effective oversight processes in place for the career progression of research scientists.
"to determine whether branch guidance, information and tools are available and communicated to support career progression for research scientists."
b) succession planning for research scientists: to determine whether succession planning processes for research scientists are in place and followed as per treasury board guidelines.
to determine whether there are effective oversight processes in place for the succession planning of research scientists.
"to determine whether branch guidance, information and tools are available and communicated to support succession planning for research scientists."
"this section presents the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provides recommendations for improvement."
"the audit reviewed stb-s sharepoint site and confirmed that the letter and documents are posted on the site. in addition, there was a listing of committee chairs and a general inquiries email address."
"the interviews confirmed that aafc research scientists received an annual -call- letter from the adm, stb inviting them to prepare and submit an application for promotion."
interviews also confirmed that career progression information sessions were held in several research centres to help inform scientists of the promotion process.
the audit reviewed a sample of 20 detailed application assessments and rating reports prepared by the review committees during 2012-13 and 2013-14 and confirmed that assessments were performed in a consistent manner among all committees.
"the audit also confirmed that the committees assessed and scored applications using rating reports that aligned with the framework-s balanced assessment on valued outcomes (innovation, productivity, impact and recognition)."
"based on a review of the stb sharepoint and intranet sites and interviews with three of five (60%) of the committee chairs, the audit determined there were no terms of references for any of the four res-level career progression committees."
"the audit also noted that there were no terms of reference posted on the stb sharepoint site, nor on the stb intranet site. in addition, promotion committee members were not listed on these sites."
"target date for completion: august 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, science and technology branch communication of results based on research scientist interviews and a review of supporting promotion file documentation, the audit determined that all applicants were provided with a decision letter from the dcprc chair and a career progression rating report."
thirteen of 24 (54%) research scientists interviewed indicated that the feedback provided within the decision letter and career progression rating report did not provide adequate information on how certain assessment criteria were not met and how to improve their application for a subsequent year.
the audit reviewed a sampling of 12 decision letters and career progression rating reports provided to unsuccessful res applicants and found that explanations on decisions were insufficient for assessment criteria in eight of 12 cases (67%).
"the research scientists interviewed indicated that five of the 12 (42%) unsuccessful applicants contacted the chair to obtain further explanations, and all five research scientists commented that the feedback provided was not beneficial in understanding how to improve their application for potential resubmission in a subsequent year."
"in addition, the audit observed that the career promotion committees did not provide a consistent level of feedback for similar cases."
"based on supporting documents and interviews, the audit noted that one committee chair provided unsuccessful applicants with access to their -in-depth- committee reports upon request; while the remaining two of three (66%) committee chairs that were interviewed did not provide access to -in-depth- committee reports, unless a recourse action was undertaken."
insufficient and inconsistent feedback provided to unsuccessful applicants may increase the potential risk that applicants may continue to be unsuccessful in their re-application for promotion during a subsequent year and/or in a perceived lack of fairness in the process.
"recommendation 2: the adm, science and technology branch should ensure there is sufficient and consistent feedback provided to applicants and their research, development and technology director management team."
"target date for completion: august 31, 2016 lead(s) responsible: adm, science and technology branch recourse mechanism the audit confirmed that aafc also has an independent recourse mechanism in place for se-res applicants and the process aligns with the independent recourse mechanism (irm) as part of the career progression framework."
"in four cases, independent reviewers were assigned and confirmed as being all external to aafc with the exception of one due to language and qualification requirements."
"the audit confirmed that in all cases, the independent reviewer provided results of their assessments to the deputy minister who, based on recommendations from the assistant deputy minister, corporate management branch, provided applicants with a final decision."
"the audit found that stb had some processes and documentation in place for succession planning, which included: sector strategies, centre profiles, staffing plans, and the postdoctoral research pilot program."
"the audit noted that the branch performs demographic analytics to determine trends, for example: to identify areas where retirement is most prevalent."
the audit also noted that succession planning was not listed within the terms of reference for stb-s branch executive committee and the branch implementation and human resources committee.
"there is no documented program design framework to validate that new and modified activities comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and treasury board policy requirements, and to consult with primary stakeholders."
"(criteria 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 24, 27, 34) the cihr programs and initiatives under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions reflect a broad range of attributes."
"they range from low dollar-value, one-time targeted awards to high-value, multi-partner, long-term commitments that establish enabling structures for research."
"using an umbrella set of terms & conditions to encompass this wide range of initiatives provides flexibility, but can add complexity to the design and development of those initiatives."
treasury board policy requires that program managers assess a set of core design elements and document evidence of their consideration when designing or redesigning a transfer payment program.
this is usually addressed through the development and approval process for the program terms & conditions.
"as a result, there are core design elements that should be considered or at a minimum validated during the design and development of new initiatives."
"cihr-s program suite can be grouped into three broad categories: operating support, career support (both under the investigator initiated area) and priority driven."
"the first two categories generally comprise initiatives that are (or will be) repeated on a regular basis, for example the project and foundation schemes and cihr fellowships."
"priority driven initiatives are heterogeneous, encompassing a variety of activities and include those under the purview of the institutes."
in reviewing a sample of programs and funding opportunities the following gaps were identified: grants were awarded to organizational recipients not identified in the current terms & conditions.
some grant funds were redistributed by the initial recipients as awards.
some recipients were paid in advance of meeting eligibility requirements.
grants were awarded that may have provided benefits to other federal departments.
"initiatives must comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions, the treasury board policies on which the terms & conditions are based and applicable tri-agency and internal policies."
"despite the differences in the initiatives, they follow a similar development cycle."
"initial activities include strategy setting, requirements definition and initiative planning, followed by design, launch and management of the competition."
"ongoing payments and other supporting activities comprise post-award administration, and depending on the program, a decision to continue, transition or end the initiative may be required."
this is necessary to confirm that recipients and activities are eligible under the terms & conditions.
"for example, budget profiling on large, longer-term grants such as those in the priority driven and foundation programs could alleviate the need to review and consider holdbacks later on."
"some programs run for a designated length of time while others will require a decision to continue, transition or end."
"as noted above, the use of umbrella terms & conditions provides flexibility, but adds complexity to the design and development of initiatives."
"in addition, cihr collaborates with its partner funding agencies, sshrc and nserc and to a lesser degree, cfi, on the development of common policies and guidelines related to the conduct of research and the administration of funding."
"the use of two different agreement templates, the common account and the separate funding agreement, adds another dimension."
"in summary, the requirements and obligations of funding recipients are documented in a variety of places and the actual location varies slightly depending on the following factors: if there is a published funding opportunity; if the payment is through a common account or direct payment; if there is a separate funding agreement; and which cihr and tri-agency policies are linked to from the funding opportunity and agreements."
tracking how the various obligations are addressed under different circumstances would assist program staff in the development of initiatives and impact assessment of policy changes.
identification of and review by all offices of primary interest at the right time in the development lifecycle will ensure that any issues are identified and addressed early on.
"establish a program design and development framework that identifies key approval points and required supporting documentation, and includes representation from offices of primary interest."
"responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed rkte has recently completed a lean process review of all of its priority-driven competitions and will now add a new step into the process to review the tb policy on transfer payments and the terms & conditions prior to the development of funding opportunities."
this step will ensure compliance with the recommendation.
expected completion january 2017.
these institutions undergo a review process prior to being granted status to administer cihr funds and are subject to ongoing oversight of their financial administration controls through the financial monitoring process.
"cihr is considered a small organization in terms of number of full time employees (402), but manages a large funding budget (nearly $1billion)."
"as such, the governance strategy for major initiatives will be modified to ensure a consistent level of detail is captured for all major initiatives."
"(criteria 2, 16, 31, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) as described in observation #2 above, many grants are paid via common accounts at eligible institutions, which are subject to ongoing oversight through the financial monitoring process."
"while direct payments represented only 4% ($27.9m) of the total payments made under the research projects and personnel support in fiscal year 2014-15, a small number of them are large value."
"in some cases, separate funding agreements have been established with grant recipients paid through common accounts."
"(criteria 30, 34, 35, 40, 41) financial reporting by recipients provides input into several processes, including recovery of unspent balances, requests for extensions to grants, and assessment of cash flow requirements."
"these address requirements defined by treasury board, cihr and tri-agency policies and guidelines, and the controls required for proper management and reporting of government resources."
the cihr grants and awards guide and the tri-agency financial administration guide specify that unspent balances at the end of a grant are to be returned to the crown.
accurate and timely reporting on the use of grant funds is required to support these processes.
"for the majority of grants, reporting on the use of funds occurs via the grants in aid of research statement of account, commonly referred to as the form 300."
"these reports are submitted annually, either electronically via the financial data submissions and reconciliation (fdsr) system or on paper."
"the data is then uploaded to eis, the cihr system that tracks information related to grants and payments."
paper submissions are directly entered into eis by cihr staff.
the form 300 process is labour-intensive and requires manual intervention to reconcile the amounts reported with eis.
the form 300s are primarily used to identify unspent balances to be recovered once the authorization for funding has expired.
"due to the gaps in the information on outstanding balances, amounts that are due to the crown are difficult to accurately estimate."
timing is also an issue; the form 300s are due by the end of june for the previous fiscal year and require additional time for reconciliation.
"as such, the information is not available until well after year end and has limited use in informing decisions on payments for the current year."
there are challenges to improving the process.
"unspent balances may result for several reasons, including delays in ethics approvals, approved leaves for researchers and the cihr internal budgeting processes."
"as per the standard government process, cihr is allocated budget for grants one year at a time and must spend the majority of the money within that year."
"analysis on a sample of available information indicates that larger, longer-term grants tend to carry larger annual balances and are more likely to be extended beyond their original expiry date."
(criterion 1c) the governing council (gc) of cihr is responsible for establishing policies respecting -consulting and collaborating with persons and organization that have an interest in health research.- this responsibility is assigned to gc in the cihr act.
"such a policy would enable gc to clearly outline their expectations for and the general principles to be applied to partnerships, collaborations and consultations."
"a documented policy on consulting and collaborating that is periodically reviewed and updated would establish clear expectations, roles and responsibilities for partnering, consulting and collaboration, and ensure that practices are in line with the principles and strategic direction for the agency established and approved by governing council."
governing council should establish a policy on partnerships that enumerates its expectations with regards to collaborating and consulting with external stakeholders.
"responsibility vice-president external affairs and business development action agreed the vice president, external affairs and business development (eabd), will recommend to the president that he request that governing council formally delegate responsibility for developing a policy regarding -consulting and collaborating- to the vice president, external affairs and business development if this delegation of authority is approved by governing council, the vice president, eabd, will commit to providing gc with an annual report on the progress made and results achieved related to the implementation of two corporate strategies : cihr stakeholder engagement strategy; cihr partnerships strategy expected completion: spring 2017 service standards for funding programs have not been established as per the requirement defined in the policy on transfer payments."
(criterion 25).
the treasury board policy on transfer payments requires reasonable and practical department service standards be established for transfer payments.
further guidance on what these standards should include is not provided.
the 2012 audit of grant and contribution program reforms by the office of the auditor general highlighted the following areas that two organizations had addressed: acknowledgement of application; timelines to provide funding decisions to applicants; time it takes to issue payments.
a brief survey of published service standards information from other organizations considered comparable to cihr with respect to the type of funding offered found a wide variety in the type and level of service standards.
cihr publishes formal service standards for electronic systems that address researchnet and the impact of unplanned interruptions on extensions to funding opportunity deadlines.
"in addition, each funding opportunity contains a schedule that includes the application deadline, the anticipated notice of decision and the funding start date."
"the contact centre is the central focus point for interactions with cihr by applicants, recipients and other stakeholders and is tasked with developing service standards."
the use of the newly implemented customer relationship management system should facilitate tracking and reporting of response times for certain operations.
"establishing and publishing reasonable and practical service standards would help manage client expectations, assist staff responsible for responding to prioritize their work and establish a baseline for performance measurement."
a) establish and publish a set of reasonable and practical service standards for transfer payments interactions with applicants and recipients.
"b) implement a performance measurement strategy to identify, collect and report on metrics for service standards."
"a) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed cihr-s contact centre was established in july of 2015 and is responsible for managing all inquiries from applicants and grant recipients in order to provide consistent, coordinated and integrated service delivery."
service standards are being developed and implemented over the coming months.
"expected completion: april 2017 b) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed a performance measurement strategy will be developed to identify, collect and report on the metrics for the service standards implemented in (6a)."
expected completion: april 2017 the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies require updating to reflect cihr-s current business model and ensure consistency in terminology between documents.
"(criteria 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22) the terms & conditions are the vehicle by which treasury board grants authority to cihr to distribute funding under the research projects and personnel support program."
they document how cihr addresses key aspects of the treasury board transfer payment policy requirements and outline the general structure for the program.
"internal policies, directives and processes should support and align with the terms & conditions, providing staff with clear guidance on the design and delivery of initiatives under the terms & conditions."
"the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions were last reviewed in 2011, when ministerial approval was obtained for minor updates."
"prior to that, the last major update was in november 2006."
the areas requiring review and update in the terms & conditions are: remove the -governance- section which is not required and is inaccurate; update the -class of recipients- section to reflect the changing nature of cihr-s programs as endorsed by governing council; revise the -collaboration (grants)- sub-section under the -funding types- section to reflect current funding for research enabling structures.
"consideration should be given to writing these sections as generically as possible, to avoid them becoming outdated if supporting elements change."
"the following items require review for clarification or interpretation to ensure there is consistency between the terms & conditions, the grants and awards guide and how they are used in funding opportunities."
ensure clarity and consistency in the definitions of knowledge users.
"the terms & conditions read that knowledge users must be affiliated with a post-secondary or research institution, but the grants and awards guide definition is broader, allowing knowledge users from private enterprises or media outlets."
the term -eligible institution- in the grants and awards guide refers to one that has been approved to administer cihr research funds.
staff developing funding opportunities should be clear on their intent when using the term eligible institution.
updating the terms & conditions to better align with current business models at cihr will ensure that approved authorities are clear and not overstepped.
"review and update the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies, guidelines and procedures to reflect current practice and ensure that terminology and definitions are clear and consistent between documents."
responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be the primary point of contact with tbs to ensure that the updates to the t&cs are reflective of program needs and tbs guidelines.
vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will coordinate the stakeholders- input in the revision.
the tri-agency agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards signed with each eligible institution applies to grants paid through common accounts.
the cihr funding agreement template is the basis for agreements signed with direct payment recipients and others where additional terms are required.
"the following items are missing from the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards an indemnification clause to the benefit of the crown as per requirement 8 of the directive, appendix f a clause indicating funds are subject to appropriation as per requirement #6 of the directive, appendix f."
"this clause appears in the funding opportunity template and on the authorization for funding form, but consideration should be given to adding it to the standard agreement a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f the following items are missing from the funding agreement template."
"a clause regarding termination or reduction of funding if the recipient no longer meets eligibility requirements as per requirement #7 of the directive, appendix f a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f."
"the current template includes a clause covering the values & ethics code, but not all aspects of the requirement are addressed."
missing elements may result in exposure to cihr through increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders.
review and update the funding agreement templates to accurately reflect the requirements specified in appendix f of the directive on transfer payments.
"responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed the senior corporate advisor, in consultation with the deputy chief financial officer, will revise the funding agreement template to ensure full compliance with appendix f."
"expected completion: march 2017 during the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could strengthen systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to transfer payments."
these observations have been communicated to management.
appendix audit criteria the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that delivery of programs under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions is well-controlled.
criteria reference to observations
funding opportunities were published and included individual recipients inconsistent with the current terms & conditions.
there are also activities that could be incorporated into the early planning that would assist with addressing policy requirements post-award.
"incorporating a risk-based approach (as described in observation #3) early on in the process would enable staff to shape the design, development and proposed oversight activities accordingly, focusing on the higher risk areas."
"involvement of the appropriate offices of primary interest (such as finance and legal) based on the nature and risk of the initiative, would assist in identifying and addressing potential issues early on in the development cycle."
this decision should be based on a review or assessment of how the program has achieved its stated objectives.
lack of clarity on if and where policy obligations are addressed could result in misunderstanding or obligations not being properly identified or understood.
there is no integrated approach to risk assessment and ongoing risk management of both initiatives and recipients as required by treasury board policy and directive on transfer payments.
"(criteria 3, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) treasury board revised its transfer payment policy suite in 2008 based on a set of recommendations issued by an independent blue ribbon panel that reviewed grants and contributions programs across government."
one of the cornerstones of the revised policy suite is the requirement for a risk-based approach to the design of programs and the determination of requirements for recipient monitoring and oversight.
risks are assessed at different levels within cihr.
the corporate risk profile identifies the top risks that could threaten the ability of cihr to achieve its overall objectives.
"for some programs and initiatives, risks are identified through the treasury board submission process when applicable, and through the governance strategies for major initiatives."
"within priority driven research, there are gaps in existing risk management processes at the program and initiative level."
"risks and mitigating strategies are identified and documented in treasury board submissions for those programs that require one, but there is no monitoring or reassessment of these risks to determine their continued applicability."
"while governance strategies for major initiatives do identify risks and mitigating strategies the strategies reviewed took different approaches, with some identifying risks at high-level, others in detail and some moving directly to mitigation strategies."
"for investigator initiated research, project risks were identified and assessed and mitigation strategies put in place as part of the reforms to the open programs, but the new business processes for the project and foundation scheme do not include assessment of program or recipient risks."
"the proposal to implement a case management approach for the foundation grants represents a risk mitigation strategy, but is not based on a formal risk assessment."
establishing consistent criteria for identifying and assessing risk across program areas and within specific initiatives would enable a more complete view of overall program risks and allow oversight bodies and resources to focus on risk mitigation and monitoring in the areas where it is most needed.
"resource constraints combined with the fact that all programs relate to funding and directly support the cihr mandate and strategic objectives suggest an integrated approach to program and risk assessment could be beneficial, providing senior management with a more complete view of the key risks facing the organization in achieving its objectives."
ongoing monitoring of risk and the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies is equally important as the initial identification and assessment of risk.
"risk and impact managing enterprise and program risk in a non-integrated fashion may result in key risks not being identified, prioritized and managed. a consistent approach to risk assessment and ongoing monitoring of program and initiative risks would ensure resources are focused in the areas where they are most needed."
establish an integrated and consistent approach to initial risk assessment and ongoing risk management for programs and initiatives under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions.
"responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: partially agreed although major initiatives all involve a governance strategy with a risk assessment, the level of detail is not always consistent."
"as a result, initiatives that are found to be of higher risk will have ongoing senior management monitoring."
"over the next year, cihr will be implementing enterprise risk management and as part of its planning and implementation, cihr will assess the impact and capacity to do risk management from a recipient perspective."
"the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions specify that while the majority of research funds are paid to eligible institutions, funds may be paid directly to recipients when cihr has determined that a direct payment represents an acceptable risk; however, there is no formal process for the risk assessment."
"in addition, while the treasury board directive on transfer payments allows for grants to be paid without a formal agreement, the grant must be both low risk and low materiality."
cihr has not defined thresholds for these conditions nor assigned responsibility for assessment.
direct payment recipients are not included in the financial monitoring process and there is no comparable process to assess the risks related to these recipients- use of the funds.
establishing thresholds and criteria for risk rating of these direct payment grants and awards would allow the oversight to be appropriately tailored.
"although related to recipient risk, this aspect should also be considered in the assessment of program risk discussed in observation #2, as the nature and objectives of the program will also influence the need for an agreement."
"the treasury board directive on transfer payments establishes requirements for cash management, including aligning payments to recipient cash flow requirements and holdbacks on payments when there is a risk of overpayment or lack of performance."
these risks should be considered as part of determining oversight requirements and to identify when it is appropriate to profile grant payments to better match funding needs.
"for example, the current default is to pay out all grants in equal installments over the lifetime of the funding; however for larger, long-term grants, installment payments could be more closely aligned with the recipients- cash flow requirements."
risk and impact the treasury board policy and directive on transfer payment requires managers of transfer payment programs to apply oversight and administrative requirements to recipients based on an assessment of risk.
"without a consistent and structured process to assess the risk of recipients or classes of recipients, cihr is not in compliance with this policy."
"responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be defining, documenting and implementing a risk based approach on: definitions on what is considered high versus low risk consistent use of agreements as a mitigation strategy establishing appropriate payment schedules and cash management as deemed necessary based on risk definition (see observation 4) expected completion: march 2017 recipient financial reporting is not always received in a timely fashion, constraining cihr-s ability to meet the cash management requirements as defined in the directive on transfer payments."
"the directive on transfer payments states that payment of grant installments should be aligned with recipient cash flow requirements, that funding should reflect the minimum amount required to achieve the objectives and that holdbacks be considered when appropriate."
direct payment recipients are not actively reviewed as part of the current form 300 reporting and reconciliation process.
"cihr administers thousands of grants that vary in both value and length, which means that while the aggregate unspent balances at eligible institutions may be significant, assessing each individual grant may not be feasible."
"despite these challenges, there is sufficient information available with the current process to identify higher-risk grants and focus reporting and analysis efforts on these."
"risk and impact without accurate and timely financial reporting, cihr does not have the information required to fully comply with the cash management requirements of the directive on transfer payments and to ensure government resources are prudently managed. a) review the current form 300 reporting process to determine if improvements can be made to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of reporting on use of grant funds and to leverage information for decision making."
"b) apply a risk-based approach to identify and define the information required to ensure funding levels are appropriate, payments are aligned with recipient cash flow requirements, and to identify and record debts to the crown."
"a) responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be reviewing the form 300 process based on risk to: evaluate the scope, accuracy and timing of the review; ensure proper follow up process; improve reporting for decision making."
"expected completion: march 2017 b) responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be defining, documenting and implementing a revised cash management process by: reviewing payment schedules; increasing follow-ups on recipients cash flow and amount owed to the crown; recording debts to the crown based on best estimate at reporting date."
"although gc has communicated its support for partnerships and collaboration, it has not established a policy with respect to consultation and collaboration, nor has it formally delegated this responsibility."
"while cihr has established the organization and other supporting structures that enable the agency to enter into agreements with various parties for the purpose of achieving its objectives, a policy on consulting and collaborating does not exist."
risk and impact the lack of an approved policy on consulting and collaborating is not in compliance with cihr act.
"although the terms & conditions are generally in compliance with treasury board policy, a set of minor amendments are recommended to bring them up to date, add clarity and better align with the types of initiatives cihr currently undertakes."
minor discrepancies between the terms & conditions and supporting documents were also identified; these should be reviewed and updates made to the appropriate document to ensure alignment.
"clearly define the projects, initiatives and activities and separate them from the eligible recipients; the stacking provision section contains contradictory language and does not reflect the current actions taken by cihr nor the increasing significance of partner funding; update the basis and timing of payment and the performance measurement strategy to reflect the current practices."
"which documents require updating will depend on the outcome of the review; however, a general principle is to keep the definitions broad in the terms & conditions, and include any restrictions in lower level documents, such as the grants and awards guide or the funding opportunity."
"the terms & conditions do not use this term; however, there is language regarding the type of institution with which recipients must be affiliated which can be referred to as an eligible institution."
"risk and impact the terms & conditions represent cihr-s commitment to treasury board on how the research projects and personnel support program will operate, who will receive funding and for what activities."
"expected completion: march 2018 the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards and the cihr funding agreement template are not fully compliant with the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 7, 8) the treasury board directive on transfer payments lays out the clauses that must be included in the funding agreement for a grant."
funding agreements are based on two templates.
"a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f a clause notifying the recipient regarding public dissemination of information regarding the recipient and the grant as per requirement #14 of the directive, appendix f the terms & conditions include requirements for official languages as such, a clause should be included in the template for consideration when appropriate as per requirement #16 of the directive, appendix f the information to be obtained for confirmation of ongoing eligibility, if required as per requirement #17 of the directive, appendix f a clause regarding any obligations for an environmental assessment as per requirement #24 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration as it is a requirement in regular fos. a clause regarding privacy and personal information as per requirement #25 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration."
the tri-agency framework: responsible conduct of research addresses this extensively and could be included through reference.
"risk and impact without all of the required elements, the research projects and personnel support program is not fully compliant with the treasury board directive on transfer payments."
required elements for funding agreements are defined to ensure funding agreements minimize risks to cihr and enable programs to achieve their objectives.
eligible institutions and recipients may not be aware of all their obligations.
"there is no documented program design framework to validate that new and modified activities comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and treasury board policy requirements, and to consult with primary stakeholders."
"(criteria 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 24, 27, 34) the cihr programs and initiatives under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions reflect a broad range of attributes."
"they range from low dollar-value, one-time targeted awards to high-value, multi-partner, long-term commitments that establish enabling structures for research."
"using an umbrella set of terms & conditions to encompass this wide range of initiatives provides flexibility, but can add complexity to the design and development of those initiatives."
treasury board policy requires that program managers assess a set of core design elements and document evidence of their consideration when designing or redesigning a transfer payment program.
this is usually addressed through the development and approval process for the program terms & conditions.
"as a result, there are core design elements that should be considered or at a minimum validated during the design and development of new initiatives."
"cihr-s program suite can be grouped into three broad categories: operating support, career support (both under the investigator initiated area) and priority driven."
"the first two categories generally comprise initiatives that are (or will be) repeated on a regular basis, for example the project and foundation schemes and cihr fellowships."
"priority driven initiatives are heterogeneous, encompassing a variety of activities and include those under the purview of the institutes."
in reviewing a sample of programs and funding opportunities the following gaps were identified: grants were awarded to organizational recipients not identified in the current terms & conditions.
some grant funds were redistributed by the initial recipients as awards.
some recipients were paid in advance of meeting eligibility requirements.
grants were awarded that may have provided benefits to other federal departments.
"initiatives must comply with the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions, the treasury board policies on which the terms & conditions are based and applicable tri-agency and internal policies."
"despite the differences in the initiatives, they follow a similar development cycle."
"initial activities include strategy setting, requirements definition and initiative planning, followed by design, launch and management of the competition."
"ongoing payments and other supporting activities comprise post-award administration, and depending on the program, a decision to continue, transition or end the initiative may be required."
this is necessary to confirm that recipients and activities are eligible under the terms & conditions.
"for example, budget profiling on large, longer-term grants such as those in the priority driven and foundation programs could alleviate the need to review and consider holdbacks later on."
"some programs run for a designated length of time while others will require a decision to continue, transition or end."
"as noted above, the use of umbrella terms & conditions provides flexibility, but adds complexity to the design and development of initiatives."
"in addition, cihr collaborates with its partner funding agencies, sshrc and nserc and to a lesser degree, cfi, on the development of common policies and guidelines related to the conduct of research and the administration of funding."
"the use of two different agreement templates, the common account and the separate funding agreement, adds another dimension."
"in summary, the requirements and obligations of funding recipients are documented in a variety of places and the actual location varies slightly depending on the following factors: if there is a published funding opportunity; if the payment is through a common account or direct payment; if there is a separate funding agreement; and which cihr and tri-agency policies are linked to from the funding opportunity and agreements."
tracking how the various obligations are addressed under different circumstances would assist program staff in the development of initiatives and impact assessment of policy changes.
identification of and review by all offices of primary interest at the right time in the development lifecycle will ensure that any issues are identified and addressed early on.
"establish a program design and development framework that identifies key approval points and required supporting documentation, and includes representation from offices of primary interest."
"responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed rkte has recently completed a lean process review of all of its priority-driven competitions and will now add a new step into the process to review the tb policy on transfer payments and the terms & conditions prior to the development of funding opportunities."
this step will ensure compliance with the recommendation.
expected completion january 2017.
these institutions undergo a review process prior to being granted status to administer cihr funds and are subject to ongoing oversight of their financial administration controls through the financial monitoring process.
"cihr is considered a small organization in terms of number of full time employees (402), but manages a large funding budget (nearly $1billion)."
"as such, the governance strategy for major initiatives will be modified to ensure a consistent level of detail is captured for all major initiatives."
"(criteria 2, 16, 31, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) as described in observation #2 above, many grants are paid via common accounts at eligible institutions, which are subject to ongoing oversight through the financial monitoring process."
"while direct payments represented only 4% ($27.9m) of the total payments made under the research projects and personnel support in fiscal year 2014-15, a small number of them are large value."
"in some cases, separate funding agreements have been established with grant recipients paid through common accounts."
"(criteria 30, 34, 35, 40, 41) financial reporting by recipients provides input into several processes, including recovery of unspent balances, requests for extensions to grants, and assessment of cash flow requirements."
"these address requirements defined by treasury board, cihr and tri-agency policies and guidelines, and the controls required for proper management and reporting of government resources."
the cihr grants and awards guide and the tri-agency financial administration guide specify that unspent balances at the end of a grant are to be returned to the crown.
accurate and timely reporting on the use of grant funds is required to support these processes.
"for the majority of grants, reporting on the use of funds occurs via the grants in aid of research statement of account, commonly referred to as the form 300."
"these reports are submitted annually, either electronically via the financial data submissions and reconciliation (fdsr) system or on paper."
"the data is then uploaded to eis, the cihr system that tracks information related to grants and payments."
paper submissions are directly entered into eis by cihr staff.
the form 300 process is labour-intensive and requires manual intervention to reconcile the amounts reported with eis.
the form 300s are primarily used to identify unspent balances to be recovered once the authorization for funding has expired.
"due to the gaps in the information on outstanding balances, amounts that are due to the crown are difficult to accurately estimate."
timing is also an issue; the form 300s are due by the end of june for the previous fiscal year and require additional time for reconciliation.
"as such, the information is not available until well after year end and has limited use in informing decisions on payments for the current year."
there are challenges to improving the process.
"unspent balances may result for several reasons, including delays in ethics approvals, approved leaves for researchers and the cihr internal budgeting processes."
"as per the standard government process, cihr is allocated budget for grants one year at a time and must spend the majority of the money within that year."
"analysis on a sample of available information indicates that larger, longer-term grants tend to carry larger annual balances and are more likely to be extended beyond their original expiry date."
(criterion 1c) the governing council (gc) of cihr is responsible for establishing policies respecting -consulting and collaborating with persons and organization that have an interest in health research.- this responsibility is assigned to gc in the cihr act.
"such a policy would enable gc to clearly outline their expectations for and the general principles to be applied to partnerships, collaborations and consultations."
"a documented policy on consulting and collaborating that is periodically reviewed and updated would establish clear expectations, roles and responsibilities for partnering, consulting and collaboration, and ensure that practices are in line with the principles and strategic direction for the agency established and approved by governing council."
governing council should establish a policy on partnerships that enumerates its expectations with regards to collaborating and consulting with external stakeholders.
"responsibility vice-president external affairs and business development action agreed the vice president, external affairs and business development (eabd), will recommend to the president that he request that governing council formally delegate responsibility for developing a policy regarding -consulting and collaborating- to the vice president, external affairs and business development if this delegation of authority is approved by governing council, the vice president, eabd, will commit to providing gc with an annual report on the progress made and results achieved related to the implementation of two corporate strategies : cihr stakeholder engagement strategy; cihr partnerships strategy expected completion: spring 2017 service standards for funding programs have not been established as per the requirement defined in the policy on transfer payments."
(criterion 25).
the treasury board policy on transfer payments requires reasonable and practical department service standards be established for transfer payments.
further guidance on what these standards should include is not provided.
the 2012 audit of grant and contribution program reforms by the office of the auditor general highlighted the following areas that two organizations had addressed: acknowledgement of application; timelines to provide funding decisions to applicants; time it takes to issue payments.
a brief survey of published service standards information from other organizations considered comparable to cihr with respect to the type of funding offered found a wide variety in the type and level of service standards.
cihr publishes formal service standards for electronic systems that address researchnet and the impact of unplanned interruptions on extensions to funding opportunity deadlines.
"in addition, each funding opportunity contains a schedule that includes the application deadline, the anticipated notice of decision and the funding start date."
"the contact centre is the central focus point for interactions with cihr by applicants, recipients and other stakeholders and is tasked with developing service standards."
the use of the newly implemented customer relationship management system should facilitate tracking and reporting of response times for certain operations.
"establishing and publishing reasonable and practical service standards would help manage client expectations, assist staff responsible for responding to prioritize their work and establish a baseline for performance measurement."
a) establish and publish a set of reasonable and practical service standards for transfer payments interactions with applicants and recipients.
"b) implement a performance measurement strategy to identify, collect and report on metrics for service standards."
"a) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed cihr-s contact centre was established in july of 2015 and is responsible for managing all inquiries from applicants and grant recipients in order to provide consistent, coordinated and integrated service delivery."
service standards are being developed and implemented over the coming months.
"expected completion: april 2017 b) responsibility vice-president research, knowledge translation and ethics & chief scientific officer action: agreed a performance measurement strategy will be developed to identify, collect and report on the metrics for the service standards implemented in (6a)."
expected completion: april 2017 the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies require updating to reflect cihr-s current business model and ensure consistency in terminology between documents.
"(criteria 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22) the terms & conditions are the vehicle by which treasury board grants authority to cihr to distribute funding under the research projects and personnel support program."
they document how cihr addresses key aspects of the treasury board transfer payment policy requirements and outline the general structure for the program.
"internal policies, directives and processes should support and align with the terms & conditions, providing staff with clear guidance on the design and delivery of initiatives under the terms & conditions."
"the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions were last reviewed in 2011, when ministerial approval was obtained for minor updates."
"prior to that, the last major update was in november 2006."
the areas requiring review and update in the terms & conditions are: remove the -governance- section which is not required and is inaccurate; update the -class of recipients- section to reflect the changing nature of cihr-s programs as endorsed by governing council; revise the -collaboration (grants)- sub-section under the -funding types- section to reflect current funding for research enabling structures.
"consideration should be given to writing these sections as generically as possible, to avoid them becoming outdated if supporting elements change."
"the following items require review for clarification or interpretation to ensure there is consistency between the terms & conditions, the grants and awards guide and how they are used in funding opportunities."
ensure clarity and consistency in the definitions of knowledge users.
"the terms & conditions read that knowledge users must be affiliated with a post-secondary or research institution, but the grants and awards guide definition is broader, allowing knowledge users from private enterprises or media outlets."
the term -eligible institution- in the grants and awards guide refers to one that has been approved to administer cihr research funds.
staff developing funding opportunities should be clear on their intent when using the term eligible institution.
updating the terms & conditions to better align with current business models at cihr will ensure that approved authorities are clear and not overstepped.
"review and update the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions and supporting policies, guidelines and procedures to reflect current practice and ensure that terminology and definitions are clear and consistent between documents."
responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed. vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will be the primary point of contact with tbs to ensure that the updates to the t&cs are reflective of program needs and tbs guidelines.
vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer will coordinate the stakeholders- input in the revision.
the tri-agency agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards signed with each eligible institution applies to grants paid through common accounts.
the cihr funding agreement template is the basis for agreements signed with direct payment recipients and others where additional terms are required.
"the following items are missing from the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards an indemnification clause to the benefit of the crown as per requirement 8 of the directive, appendix f a clause indicating funds are subject to appropriation as per requirement #6 of the directive, appendix f."
"this clause appears in the funding opportunity template and on the authorization for funding form, but consideration should be given to adding it to the standard agreement a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f the following items are missing from the funding agreement template."
"a clause regarding termination or reduction of funding if the recipient no longer meets eligibility requirements as per requirement #7 of the directive, appendix f a provision regarding the conflict of interest legislation and codes applicable to current and former public servants and members of the senate and house of commons as per requirement #11 of the directive, appendix f."
"the current template includes a clause covering the values & ethics code, but not all aspects of the requirement are addressed."
missing elements may result in exposure to cihr through increased scrutiny or damage to cihr's reputation among stakeholders.
review and update the funding agreement templates to accurately reflect the requirements specified in appendix f of the directive on transfer payments.
"responsibility vice-president resource planning and management & chief financial officer action agreed the senior corporate advisor, in consultation with the deputy chief financial officer, will revise the funding agreement template to ensure full compliance with appendix f."
"expected completion: march 2017 during the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could strengthen systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to transfer payments."
these observations have been communicated to management.
appendix audit criteria the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that delivery of programs under the research projects and personnel support terms & conditions is well-controlled.
criteria reference to observations
funding opportunities were published and included individual recipients inconsistent with the current terms & conditions.
there are also activities that could be incorporated into the early planning that would assist with addressing policy requirements post-award.
"incorporating a risk-based approach (as described in observation #3) early on in the process would enable staff to shape the design, development and proposed oversight activities accordingly, focusing on the higher risk areas."
"involvement of the appropriate offices of primary interest (such as finance and legal) based on the nature and risk of the initiative, would assist in identifying and addressing potential issues early on in the development cycle."
this decision should be based on a review or assessment of how the program has achieved its stated objectives.
lack of clarity on if and where policy obligations are addressed could result in misunderstanding or obligations not being properly identified or understood.
there is no integrated approach to risk assessment and ongoing risk management of both initiatives and recipients as required by treasury board policy and directive on transfer payments.
"(criteria 3, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41) treasury board revised its transfer payment policy suite in 2008 based on a set of recommendations issued by an independent blue ribbon panel that reviewed grants and contributions programs across government."
one of the cornerstones of the revised policy suite is the requirement for a risk-based approach to the design of programs and the determination of requirements for recipient monitoring and oversight.
risks are assessed at different levels within cihr.
the corporate risk profile identifies the top risks that could threaten the ability of cihr to achieve its overall objectives.
"for some programs and initiatives, risks are identified through the treasury board submission process when applicable, and through the governance strategies for major initiatives."
"within priority driven research, there are gaps in existing risk management processes at the program and initiative level."
"risks and mitigating strategies are identified and documented in treasury board submissions for those programs that require one, but there is no monitoring or reassessment of these risks to determine their continued applicability."
"while governance strategies for major initiatives do identify risks and mitigating strategies the strategies reviewed took different approaches, with some identifying risks at high-level, others in detail and some moving directly to mitigation strategies."

"which documents require updating will depend on the outcome of the review; however, a general principle is to keep the definitions broad in the terms & conditions, and include any restrictions in lower level documents, such as the grants and awards guide or the funding opportunity."
"the terms & conditions do not use this term; however, there is language regarding the type of institution with which recipients must be affiliated which can be referred to as an eligible institution."
"risk and impact the terms & conditions represent cihr-s commitment to treasury board on how the research projects and personnel support program will operate, who will receive funding and for what activities."
"expected completion: march 2018 the agreement on the administration of agency grants and awards and the cihr funding agreement template are not fully compliant with the requirements defined by appendix f: funding agreement provisions for grants of the directive on transfer payments (criterion 7, 8) the treasury board directive on transfer payments lays out the clauses that must be included in the funding agreement for a grant."
funding agreements are based on two templates.
"a declaration regarding compliance with the lobbying act as per requirement #12 of the directive, appendix f a clause notifying the recipient regarding public dissemination of information regarding the recipient and the grant as per requirement #14 of the directive, appendix f the terms & conditions include requirements for official languages as such, a clause should be included in the template for consideration when appropriate as per requirement #16 of the directive, appendix f the information to be obtained for confirmation of ongoing eligibility, if required as per requirement #17 of the directive, appendix f a clause regarding any obligations for an environmental assessment as per requirement #24 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration as it is a requirement in regular fos. a clause regarding privacy and personal information as per requirement #25 of the directive, appendix f. although optional, it should be in the template for consideration."
the tri-agency framework: responsible conduct of research addresses this extensively and could be included through reference.
"risk and impact without all of the required elements, the research projects and personnel support program is not fully compliant with the treasury board directive on transfer payments."
required elements for funding agreements are defined to ensure funding agreements minimize risks to cihr and enable programs to achieve their objectives.
eligible institutions and recipients may not be aware of all their obligations.
the purpose of this management letter is to provide details on an administrative finding which falls outside the scope of the audit.
this letter constitutes advice to stb management and is being issued during the debriefing sessions at the conclusion of the audit-s conduct phase.
the audit objective was to determine whether an effective management framework is in place for promotion and succession planning of research scientists at aafc.
a management response and action plan should be developed for the finding listed in this management letter.
progress on the management response and action plan will be tracked and reported on to the departmental audit committee.
a copy of this letter will also be retained on file and internal audit may consider these observations during any future audits of this area.
"the audit report will be tabled at the departmental audit committee meeting scheduled for april 26, 2016 and the attached management letter will be provided to the members of the committee for information."
"if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 613-773-3551 or mark shwed, senior manager, internal audit at 613-773-0912. nancy hamzawi director general, office of audit and evaluation attachments: a - management letter findings b - about the audit of promotion and succession planning of research scientists c - acronyms used cc: michael whittaker, stb a - management letter additional details for observations noted during the audit."
"other stb data analysis included employment equity statistics (women, aboriginal people, visible minorities and persons with disabilities) by region and by occupational groups."
"options for consideration: the adm of stb should consider expanding demographic analysis, which is currently being performed, to include additional se-res specific metrics that would help identify and address current, projected or new gaps, including employment equity."
.
this additional information should be considered during succession planning activities for se-res within stb.
"the terms of reference for the project were approved by the chief audit executive on april 30, 2015. audit objective the objective of this audit is to determine whether an effective management framework is in place for promotion and succession planning of research scientists at aafc."
"the audit reviewed succession planning and promotional processes that were in place for the last three fiscal years, with an emphasis on the most recent 2014-15 fiscal year."
"information from corporate management branch (cmb), human resources directorate was also gathered in support of the audit of succession planning and promotion of research scientists."
agreed.
"stb is in the process of developing frequently asked questions, which will be posted to a sharepoint site accessible and advertised to all branch staff."
we will develop a system whereby a senior scientist is made available to junior scientists to provide guidance in completing and submitting the promotion dossier.
stb will publish a list of successful applicants for promotion following the annual exercise; this will make it easier for new applicants to find suitable mentors.
stb will make presentations in french and english to all se-res at the beginning of the annual call for career progression.
"september 30, 2016 the adm, science and technology branch the adm of stb should consider expanding demographic analysis, which is currently being performed, to include additional se-res specific metrics that would help identify and address current, projected or new gaps, including employment equity."
this additional information should be considered during succession planning activities for se-res within stb.
agreed.
"additional demographic metrics, relating to employment equity groups and to se-res specific issues such as subject matter expertise, will be developed annually for the se-res community to be used by the branch implementation and human resources committee and the branch executive committee in discussions of se-res succession planning."
"september 30, 2016 the adm, science and technology branch audit of promotion and succession planning of research scientists management letter"
"brian t. gray assistant deputy minister, science and technology branch (stb) t5-6-330, 1341 baseline road ottawa, ontario k1a 0c5 reference: audit of promotion and succession planning of research scientists management letters are a supplemental reporting mechanism to audit reports, and are used to convey matters such as significant findings or risks that require immediate management attention, or findings that fall outside the scope of the engagement."
"as part of this engagement, the audit noted the need to perform additional, demographic data analytics on the research scientist population within aafc, including whether there are gaps and or concerns related to employment equity."
eleven of the 24 interviewees (46%) confirmed awareness of these sessions and 7 of the attendees found them beneficial.
although the presentation used for the information session was available on the stb sharepoint site; the audit noted that the -frequently asked questions- slide within this presentation was not updated based on annual information session feedback.
"the audit did not find that the recommendations from the committees- post mortems from 2013-14 and 2014-15 were used to update and revise guidance materials and resources, including the presentation used during information sessions, where possible."
"while a majority of scientists used informal means to have colleagues provide comments and feedback on their application, some scientists: 2 of 24 (8%) did not have access to suitable colleagues who could act as career progression coaches within their field of research."
"in addition, 5 of 24 (21%) of se-res interviewees indicated that the level of feedback from research, development and technology directors was incomplete or inconsistent for various reasons, such as their lack of availability/time constraints, or the research, development and technology director was new or acting in the position."
the audit noted that a listing of successful applicants was not communicated to the research scientist community within stb.
eleven of 24 (46%) of research scientists interviewed indicated there was an interest to have access to examples of successful applications and/or to know of previously successful applicants for additional guidance or to help review their application.
"without sufficient tools and/or guidance to prepare for promotion applications, there is a potential risk that applications may not be adequately prepared."
"options for consideration: the adm, science and technology branch should ensure that all research scientists have access to up-to-date guidance materials and resources, including: frequently asked questions and answers from information sessions on promotion process; promotion committees- prior year observations/feedback; and access to a suitable career progression coach when colleague(s) are not available."
"finding # 2 - demographic data analytics on research scientists finding the audit noted that stb performs data analysis and reports on demographic information for research scientists, such as: scientific research group - research scientists (se-res) departures and new hires by level."
the employment equity data developed is compared to workforce availability estimates (wae) - although based on 2006 census - and the public service.
"as part of the benchmarking exercise, the audit found that several other departments, who co-signed the career progression management framework for federal researchers, were conducting detailed demographic analysis to identify and address gaps in their se-res population, including gender analysis."
"without this additional demographic information on research scientists, aafc may not have a complete understanding of the gaps within the scientific researcher group at aafc (or potential future gaps), including employment equity, which could impact the development of appropriate action plans."
b - audit of promotion and succession planning of research scientists this audit was approved by the deputy minister as part of the 2014-2017 risk-based audit plan.
"scope in terms of promotion, the audit focused on the se-res group, given the unique promotion process for research scientists at aafc; through an incumbent-based process based on the employee's accomplishments, and not based on changes to the duties in the work description the succession planning portion of this engagement likewise focused on the se-res group."

management responses were provided and include: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan.
quantitative data on program management controls would help focus management action on specific areas of weakness in the program and obstacles to achieving the program-s objectives.
management response and action plan management response and action plan: a) agreed.
b) agreed.
lead(s) responsible: manager - ipd - program design and performance division target date for completion: november 2016 arrears and default tolerance the treasury board-s directive on transfer payments states that contributions made to for-profit businesses that are intended to allow the businesses to generate profits or increase the value of the businesses are to be repayable.
"in alignment with the treasury board directive, the enabling commercialization and adoption stream is designed to provide interest-free repayable contribution funding to companies to allow them to leverage other sources of financing and reduce cash flow pressures on the company."
the program assesses the financial viability of applicant companies as part of the evaluation of potential projects.
many of the recipient organizations are new and have a limited operational history and finances.
programs branch also implemented quarterly reporting to senior management on recipients with accounts in repayment default or arrears.
"as at july 15, 2016, the program was in the early stages of managing repayments; there were a total of 28 approved projects, comprised of 19 (68%) in the active project phase or in the one-year grace period before repayments commence and 9 (32%) in the active repayment phase."
"of these 9 projects in repayment, 8 had commenced repayments within the past year."
"the program had disbursed a total of $73,107,683 and had received repayments of $2,044,404 (3% of total disbursements)."
"this will also support the government-s focus on supporting business and entrepreneurs become more innovative, competitive and successful."
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
it is recognized that defining arrears and default tolerance levels can help in achieving the program-s innovation objectives.
"ipd, in consultation with corporate management branch - accounts receivable and revenues management, will define arrears and default tolerance levels for repayments under agriinnovation program - enabling commercialization and adoption stream and future programs."
"conduct a review of the current repayment monitoring processes, including communicating with the recipient when repayments are in arrears, when a notice of default is initiated and when files are transferred to accounts receivable and revenues management for further action."
define tolerance levels to support industry-led activities across the innovation continuum in line with the program terms and conditions.
lead(s) responsible: manager - ipd - claims/repayment division - repayment/financial business case analysis target date for completion: january 2017 stewardship information for management during project assessment the treasury board policy on transfer payments and related directive and guideline outline the requirements that federal departments must adhere to in managing transfer payment programs.
"in line with these requirements, the department established terms and conditions for the program that identify the specific criteria to be used in the assessment of funding applications."
the program-s review of applications provides the foundation for recommendations to fund or reject projects and has a direct impact on the achievement of the program-s objectives.
"as noted in the treasury board policy on information management, the department must ensure that -decisions and decision-making processes are documented to account for and support the continuity of departmental operations, permit the reconstruction of the evolution of policies and programs, and allow for independent evaluation, audit and review.- aafc-s management control framework for contribution programs (march 2015) reinforces the responsibility to ensure the collection of quality information and the use of this information to make decisions."
"on this basis, the audit team expected that the activities undertaken by the program to assess applications should be documented on the project files."
all potential program applicants must first submit a project screening summary.
the summary is used as background for a teleconference discussion between the potential applicant and program staff.
"as at january 7, 2016, the program had received approximately 260 project screening summaries and approximately 80 full applications."
program management identified that the intention of the screening process was to provide potential applicants with direct access to informal advice from program staff which in turn would help these companies to make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with full applications.
"applicants are required to complete a full application package that includes a detailed business plan, project work plan, budget, and various administrative documents."
the program reviews each application and assesses it for completeness.
"once the full application is deemed complete, the program officer conducts an analysis on the application, which is also sent to internal aafc experts who conduct technical, market and detailed financial reviews of the application."
"the result of this work is compiled in a due diligence summary form which includes a recommendation on whether or not to fund the project, signed by the program officer and program manager."
"the due diligence form is then summarized into a project recommendation form, signed by the program director, and submitted to the required governance committee: directors general (dg) innovation committee."
internal audit reviewed a judgmental sample of six approved and two rejected projects (where a full application was received) to analyze the documentation and assessment of program applications under each of the categories noted above.
the final assessment documentation showed that the financial capacity assessment was consistently documented.
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
programs branch will review the program-s due diligence process with program officers to ensure that the requirements for validating applicant information and performing related analysis for each criterion are clear and reflected in the documentation on file.
"further programs branch will inform management through the project approval documentation e.g. project recommendation form, memo for decision that additional assessment information is available from the program for their review upon request."
lead(s) responsible: director - ipd - enabling commercialization and adoption stream target date for completion: september 2016 financial assessment the repayment/financial business case analysis unit was created in october 2012 and since then has developed a financial analysis process and related analytical methodology to assess applications to the program.
the financial analysis of applications is highly complex and currently carried out by a small team of one senior officer and one officer in training.
"given that all of the program-s applications are reviewed by this unit, its work is strategically important to project assessment."
the financial viability of applicant companies is one of the factors used by the program to evaluate potential projects.
the financial viability of the applicant company is assessed in two levels.
"at the first level, the analysis looks at the historical financial performance of the applicant company."
a financial review report is subsequently generated by the financial analysis officer and signed by the repayment/financial business case analysis unit-s management team.
the financial analysis officer makes one of three recommendations in the report: do not proceed.
proceed with conditions.
(e.g. gather more information) end financial analysis at level 1 due to the very strong financial history of the applicant.
"(i.e. no additional value in proceeding to a level 2 assessment) if the first level financial review indicates the need to gather more information, then the financial analysis team will proceed to a level 2 assessment."
"at this second level, the financial analysis focuses on the future financial outlook of the company and considers the ability of the company to repay the contribution over the long-term repayment period."
the financial analysis officer then prepares a level 2 financial summary report which is signed by the repayment/financial business case analysis unit manager and then submitted to the program officer for inclusion in the due diligence documentation.
"furthermore, there is no periodic external review of the financial analysis methodology to assess whether it reflects current best practices."
"the financial review of applications is critical to the assessment and approval of projects within the program, providing information to determine whether projects are likely to be completed and if funding is likely to be repaid."
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
ipd will conduct a validation of the results of the financial assessments and methodology by: engaging with private industry and/or other government departments to become informed on leading financial analysis best practices.
"lead(s) responsible: manager - ipd - claims/repayment division - repayment/financial business case analysis target date for completion: march 2017 claims processing after ministerial approval of a project, the recipient and the department enter into a contribution agreement detailing the terms and conditions for the use of the funding and the obligations of both parties."
the recipient must submit claims for project-related expenditures to the department in order to be reimbursed.
claims are processed by both the program and the finance claims unit.
internal audit reviewed the documentation for the claims process and found that processes and procedures related to claims processing and section 34 account verification have been established and roles and responsibilities of staff are defined.
internal audit was informed that this process was also recently reviewed to identify process improvements and efficiencies.
"repayment policies and procedures the treasury board policy on transfer payments requires that departments ensure that cost-effective oversight, internal control, performance measurement and reporting systems are in place to support the management of transfer payments."
program officers manage project files until the final payment has been disbursed and the project file is closed.
ownership of the file is then transferred to the repayment/ financial business case analysis unit that manages the repayment process and monitoring for all repayable programs.
"internal audit was informed that recipients for the program are on monthly repayment schedules with the repayment unit ensuring that billings are invoiced each month, as per the contribution agreement (or amended) payment schedule."
internal audit was advised that the repayment/financial business case analysis unit regularly monitors the status of recipient payments.
it maintains an on-going arrears list to track recipients who are behind in repayments.
"as this work is critical and on-going, formally documenting current practices would assist with making process improvements in the future and also acts as a helpful orientation tool to support staff turnover."
"it would also support consistency in repayment processing, monitoring and the application of remedial strategies for recipients in arrears."
"recommendation 5 - formal repayment policies and procedures to support the sound management of repayment processes, the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should ensure that formal policies and procedures are developed and applied for the management and monitoring of repayment processing."
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
to address this deficiency the repayment/financial business case analysis unit has been reviewing its current operational practices and consulting with other departments/corporate management branch- accounts receivable and revenues management.
"currently the unit is drafting documents which outline the roles and responsibilities of the repayment unit, provide guidelines for contacting the recipient, monitoring repayments, resolving repayment arrears, escalation to default and transferring to cmb- accounts receivable and revenues management."
a process document for managing repayments in sap and providing information to clients will also be created.
"when finalized, these documents will formalize the main aspects for managing and monitoring the unit-s repayments."
process for the assessment of project funding applications an adequate control process has been documented and is consistently applied for the assessment of project funding applications.
administration of funding procedures and guidelines for project monitoring and claims processing are documented and followed.
repayments procedures and guidelines are in place for the management of repayment processing and monitoring.
"the following sections present the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provide recommendations for improvement."
the results of the audit are organized into two themes: risk management and stewardship.
"(see figure 2) figure 2 - audit result themes risk management program-level risk assessment and response the objective of the 2012 treasury board policy on transfer payments is to ensure that transfer payment programs are managed with integrity, transparency and accountability in a manner that is sensitive to risks; are citizen- and recipient-focused; and are designed and delivered to address government priorities in achieving results for canadians."
"to that end, the directive on transfer payments requires that risk-based approaches are adopted to the design of transfer payment programs, the preparation of terms and conditions and funding agreements, and recipient monitoring and auditing."
agriculture and agri-food canada (aafc) has articulated its expectations for program-level risk management in its integrated program risk management directive (2012).
"as per this departmental directive, -integrated program risk management supports sound management of aafc programs."
"it enables the program manager and employees to identify potential events that may impede the achievement of program objectives before they occur, and to put corrective action in place so as to avoid or lessen the likelihood and/or impact of the risk.- this link between program risk management and performance management is illustrated in figure 3."
figure 3 - linkages between performance and risk management in the program lifecycle risk assessments: internal audit reviewed the program-s completed risk assessments from 2014 and 2015 and noted that they reflect a qualitative approach to risk management.
"information used in the risk assessments is based on program management-s observations about issues in areas such as application processing, approval delays, and limitations on resources, without referencing specific data that confirm these observations or quantifying the impact of these issues."
"examples of quantitative program data that could be helpful include: service standard records, number of applications processed, claims processing data, and information on repayment defaults and arrears."
the use of this type of data would add context to identified issues and allow for evidence-based decisions on the impact of risks and appropriateness of response strategies.
interviews confirmed that there were no formally documented action plans or monitoring established for the risks identified in the program-level risk assessment.
"internal audit was also informed that the risk assessment process was used primarily to facilitate discussion, on an annual basis, about the risks relevant to the program."
"as a result, risks to the achievement of program objectives may not be managed in a manner to avoid or lessen the likelihood of occurrence and/or related impact."
"as well, risks and effective mitigation strategies that could be considered when developing future programs or policy frameworks may not be captured during the risk assessment process. recommendation 1 - program-level risk assessment and response to further strengthen current risk management processes, the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should ensure that: quantitative program data is incorporated into program-level risk assessments to help inform identification of issues and decision-making; and as appropriate, action plans to mitigate identified risks are documented, implemented and monitored."
qualitative information currently included in the program-s risk assessment can be supplemented by quantitative data to better reflect the potential impact of the issues raised.
"ipd-s program design and performance division, in coordination with the commercialization and environmental programming division, will, using the departmental risk tool: include quantitative data on the program-s performance against service standards, including application processing and approval delays, in future program risk assessments."
review listed risk factors in future program risk assessments and ensure issues and impacts are quantified in all cases in which data is available.
mitigating identified risks is an important part of internal risk assessment.
"ipd-s program design and performance division will ensure that, when appropriate, information on approaches to control/mitigate risk are identified in the program risk assessment tool."
the program does not encumber the assets of recipient companies because that can be a significant barrier for recipients to securing other sources of financing necessary to undertake projects.
internal audit reviewed the program-level risk assessment and observed that it identified the residual risk of recipients not repaying contribution funding in the medium-high range.
"interviews with program management noted that the risk of non-repayment is in large part due to the nature of the program and its recipients, given that the program funds innovative projects in the pre-commercialization stage across a wide range of industries and geographic locations within canada."
"interviewees within the program noted that the application process may lead to the selection of financially stable companies or projects that involve adopting existing technologies, rather than developing new, innovative ones, which are considered higher-risk."
"interviews also indicated that although it is not anticipated that all recipients will ultimately repay the contribution funding received, there are no defined levels of defaults or arrears that are deemed tolerable for the program."
"further to this observed repayment rate, internal audit noted that arrears and default tolerance was not defined by program management in order to determine the strategic impact of potential future defaults and arrears."
"in the context of the department-s commitment to deliver results for canadians, defining the arrears and default levels that are tolerable to the program may help reduce the risk of missing opportunities to fund highly innovative projects that could be of benefit to canada."
"recommendation 2 - arrears and default tolerance to optimize the achievement of the program-s innovation objectives and manage related financial risks, the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should define the arrears and default tolerance levels accordingly."
"to support this ipd will: conduct an evidence based analysis of the arrears and default tolerances to date, as well as model risk-based repayment expectations."
"update the process for timely and appropriately actioning files in arrears, as deemed appropriate."
engage with the treasury board secretariat on appropriate risk levels for renewed program under the next agricultural policy framework.
internal audit noted that the program has formal application and assessment processes which are described in detail in the program-s applicant guide.
the program officers review the summaries to familiarize themselves with the proposed projects; however they do not make formal determinations related to eligibility.
"applications are assessed by the program in five categories (see figure 4): the innovative aspect of the proposed product, process, technology or service; technical feasibility and readiness for market of the innovation; sufficient evidence from the market to support the need and demand for the innovation; the technical and managerial capability to successfully complete the project; and, the financial capacity to complete the project and to repay the contribution."
internal audit confirmed the breadth of due diligence through interviews with program management and staff.
"in the context of the policy framework that guides the stewardship of program resources, access by management to the full extent of due diligence information could benefit the decision-making process. recommendation 3 -information for management during project assessment the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should review the processes in place to ensure that management has access to the breadth of the program's due diligence throughout the assessment phase."
"in addition, internal audit noted that although the repayment/financial business case analysis unit management signs off when financial reviews are completed, there is no secondary validation of the details of financial reviews on a project-by-project basis to ensure that there are no errors in data entry and to validate the interpretation of results."
"recommendation 4 - financial assessment in order to reduce the risk of errors and confirm the methodology used by the repayment/financial business case analysis unit, the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should implement a periodic validation of the results of the financial assessments and methodology."
conducting a review of completed financial assessments with the objective of assessing their appropriateness.
"as deemed appropriate, update the financial analysis methodology and tools to incorporate best practices and ways to reduce the risk for errors (e.g., promotion of streamlined tools and establishment of clear and consistent analysis and recommendations)."
determining an appropriate frequency for revalidation.
the process in place is such that program officers must complete the recipient/project risk management framework (rrmf) assessment form annually for each recipient.
"the results of this risk assessment determine the level and nature of monitoring and reporting for each recipient project, including the percent of sampling required to verify the eligibility of expenditures claimed by the recipient."
internal audit reviewed a sample of seven claims and found that the appropriate section 34 account verification was carried out on all claims reviewed and the appropriate level of sample verification of the eligibility of expenditures was conducted.
"interviews with the repayment/financial business case analysis unit identified that they work with recipients in arrears to obtain payments and noted that there are escalation practices for accounts in arrears at set intervals (i.e. 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.) based on interviews, the repayment/financial business case analysis unit has mature practices in place to carry out repayment processing and monitoring."
"however, internal audit was informed that formal policies and procedures do not exist."

"while no one definition is used as a -golden standard-, the institute of internal auditors (iia) defines governance as: the combination of processes and structures implemented by the board to inform, direct, manage, and monitor the activities of the organization toward the achievement of its objectives- (2011)."
"furthermore, oversight bodies should also develop plans and communicate strategic directions."
"each of these oversight bodies has formally documented mandates and/or terms of reference which assign responsibility for overseeing the management of sshrc-s programs, including pdgs and pgs."
formal minutes or records of decisions exist for each of these committees to document discussions held and resulting actions.
"day-to-day oversight of the program is provided by the vice-president, research programs and the executive director and deputy director of research grants and partnerships."
their roles and responsibilities have been documented through formal job descriptions.
"for example, the executive director is accountable for -providing leadership and direction in the design, delivery, evaluation and renewal of sshrc-s insight and connection programs-."
the deputy director holds specific responsibilities in developing and managing the delivery of partnership funding opportunities.
budget management a key activity in the management of the program is ensuring the distribution of program funds within a cycle and over the long term.
"as part of this management oversight, a formal process has been established to generate cash forecasts for the program and allocate available funds to various funding opportunities both for the upcoming year and within the year."
this process is conducted by the executive director using a system of spreadsheets with input on budget and actual disbursements from finance.
"this process leverages information related to previously committed funds, grant payments deferred as a result of finance-s deferral exercise, trends, and assumptions about the size and number of future applications."
application and adjudication at the core of sshrc-s business is the processing and adjudication of applications from the research community.
"in order for these processes to operate effectively, it is imperative that applications are vetted against established criteria by reviewers who are experts in the area and their decisions are well supported."
"to assist applicants with the grant submission process, the program has developed guidance providing details about the grants and steps of the application and adjudication process."
"guidance is available and accessible to applicants through sshrc-s website, which outlines basic characteristics of each type of grant."
"additionally, at the start of each competition cycle, sshrc hosts a joint outreach seminar for all potential applicants of sshrc grants, which includes a separate presentation by the program on the available funding opportunities."
program officers are also available during the application process to answer ad hoc questions from applicants.
"apart from the amount of funding offered and the duration of the award, the purpose of the two grants is expressed in similar ways, as shown below."
"pdgs- -develop research and related activities in the social sciences and humanities, including knowledge mobilization and the meaningful involvement of students and new scholars, by fostering new partnerships for research and related activities involving existing and/or potential partners.- pgs- -provide support for new and existing formal partnerships - to advance research, research training and/or knowledge mobilization in social sciences and humanities.- in addition to determining whether an application is pdg or pg in nature, applicants must also determine whether their application is related to one of sshrc-s three umbrella programs- talent, insight or connection."
recommendation #1: it is recommended that the program review and clarify the existing guidance provided to applicants to distinguish pg objectives from pdg objectives.
"furthermore, in reviewing the guidance, it is recommended that the program also clarify how pgs differ from pdgs across talent, insight and connection programs."
"the key objective of the program is to encourage partnerships between players from academia, private and not-for-profit sectors for the purposes of ssh research."
"as such, how these players operate and work together within the partnership is important to the program-s success, as well as maintaining sshrc-s reputation as funding world class research."
memoranda of understanding (mous) are in place between sshrc and each primary institution which outline the roles and responsibilities of the institution relative to sshrc.
"an institution may choose to establish its own mou or other form of agreement with its partners to establish roles and responsibilities, but this is not a mandatory requirement of the program."
recommendation #2: it is recommended that the program-s management engage the corporate strategy and performance division to consider the articulation and communication of minimum expectations for the conduct of partners of approved grants.
institutions are consistently assessed against eligibility criteria prior to the evaluation of grant applications.
the cornerstone of responsible granting is the assessment process.
the program has developed a multi-layered approach to assessment.
"before applications are even accepted for merit review, the program ensures the primary institution from which the applicant originates is deemed eligible."
the process also includes validating that the subject matter of the application is aligned to sshrc-s mandate and that the proposed project director has no outstanding final research reports owed to sshrc from previous grants.
"if an institution/applicant is deemed ineligible or if further follow-up is required to determine eligibility, all correspondence, including a memo outlining ineligibility, is documented and maintained on file."
"as steward of public funds, it is important that the agency has an established process for ensuring the most meritorious applications are funded and that the decisions are adequately justified."
"for example, formal assessment criteria (aligned to the program-s objectives), and rating scales have been established for the evaluation of applications by adjudication committee members who meet in person."
the reason for this may be the high volume of pdg applications received each cycle.
"recommendation #3: it is recommended that the program establish specific expectations regarding the level of feedback that will be provided to applicants, and distinguish any differences in expectations between pdgs and pgs in the program documentation."
the adjudication committee is tasked with the responsibility to review and assess application files and recommend funding decisions.
"regarding committee composition, sshrc stipulates that all committee members must be functionally bilingual and the committee must consist of at least one non-academic member and one international member."
"rather, an informal vetting process guided by professional discretion was in place to seek out and select new members, specifically accredited researchers in the community, those who have received sshrc funding in the past and people with partnership experience."
"for the sample of applications tested, a review of the associated adjudication committee members noted that members had academic and/or professional backgrounds which were generally aligned to the subject matter of the applications they reviewed."
"grant awarding and monitoring upon completion of the merit review of process, various approvals are required to comply with the financial administration act (faa) prior to the transfer of funds to the primary institutions, notably sections 32 (availability of funds) and 34 (certification that good/services have been received)."
these approvals ensure that due diligence has been paid prior to the disbursement of public funds to successful applicants.
"once the award has been paid, the monitoring of how these funds are used becomes important."
"while sshrc issues grants which are usually exempt from audit, recipients are still required to provide a minimum level of assurance that progress is being made."
"this is typically done through the submission of annual accounts statements, and progress reporting in certain cases where the investment is large and funding is multi-year."
these findings suggest that controls are in places and functioning as intended to ensure payments are approved by the right authority and in the right amount prior to release.
a formal process has been established to monitor grants and ensure adequate progress towards project objectives.
"as previously discussed, pgs are large awards that provide funding for several years (4-7 years)."
"as such, the program requires recipients to provide various reports at specific intervals to justify continued funding."
"one year after awarding a pg grant, recipients are required to submit a milestone report detailing the activities and progress they expect to achieve by the mid-point of the grant."
"at this mid-point, recipients must then submit midterm reports outlining progress achieved to date."
templates have been developed and provided to recipients to complete the milestone and midterm reporting.
"for these mid-term reports, a review committee is assembled to perform an assessment of progress."
review criteria have been established to review and compare the progress made against the milestones.
"the review committee also evaluates the participation of the partners to date, including the amount of partner contribution, and assesses whether the project is on track to achieve the proposed outcomes."
the audit tested a sample of milestone and midterm reports for pgs and noted that partner commitment and contributions were assessed and adequate documentation of the committee-s assessment was maintained to support the recommendation for continuation or termination of funding.
this suggests that a robust system is in place to ensure satisfactory performance prior to disbursing additional funds.
"as suggested in the treasury board guideline on performance measurement strategy under the policy on transfer payments, performance monitoring allows management to make relevant, timely and evidence-based decisions related to the program-s achievements and direction."
"as such, reporting of performance information to program management was found to be occurring on an ad hoc basis."
this strategy outlines the proposed performance areas and targets.
"the expected immediate, intermediate, long-term and strategic outcomes of the program have been documented in a logic model, included in the strategy."
"findings suggest that while some performance monitoring is occurring, it-s informal and not designed to assess progress towards established program objectives."
"recommendation #4: it is recommended that management establish formal performance reporting expectations (frequency, type of information, format, level of detail required) and implement a formal performance measurement framework to monitor achievement against objectives."
"conclusion partnerships funding opportunities are relatively new to sshrc (2010/11) and, as such, have benefited from the wealth of experience of staff, as well as the strengths of sshrc-s suite of programs accumulated over the years."
the program is well managed.
"the audit identified several positive findings in areas linked to the integrity of the program, most noteworthy were findings related to the adjudication of applications."
"the adjudication process is a complex activity that involves numerous steps and points of assessment, and a number of stakeholders."
"furthermore, the program-s merit review assessments were found to be consistent, well documented and decisions were supported by thorough justifications, highlighting the quality of the merit reviewer-s work, as well as the diligence and professionalism of the program-s staff."
"nonetheless, the audit identified areas of continued improvement for management-s consideration."
these include clarifying the distinction between pgs and pdgs within the program-s design; communicating minimum expectations for conduct to partners who use public funds; and the strengthening of program-level performance monitoring.
these audit findings represent an opportunity for management to reflect and consider strategic improvements going forward.

"governance and risk management governance has a myriad of definitions and depends on a variety of organizational, structural, and cultural factors."
guidance provided by the office of the comptroller general (2011) expands on the above definition and suggests that oversight bodies should have clear roles with respect to risk management and control to ensure objectives are achieved.
a governance framework has been formally established for the program to oversee its activities and manage risk the audit found that the following oversight bodies have been established for ongoing oversight and decision making relative to the program: business integration committee (bic); senior management committee (smc); and program and quality (p&q) sub-committee of sshrc-s council.
these oversight bodies have also been assigned responsibility to ensure risks are adequately mitigated as well as to monitor progress towards each program-s objectives.
"risk management the success of any program hinges on the identification, mitigation and monitoring of program management risks before they arise."
"while the audit found that a formal risk management framework had not yet been established within the program, an informal approach was in place."
"the program was found to actively manage risk based on the sharing of information between the deputy director, executive director, and the vice-president."
it should be noted that at the time of this audit sshrc was exploring opportunities to improve their risk management approach.
"as such, no risk management recommendations are put forth in this audit."
grants are awarded based on merit and recommendations for funding are put forth by a committee of merit reviewers.
guidance provided to applicants does not clearly distinguish the objectives of the different grants.
"based on the review of the guidance provided to applicants, the audit found that the documentation does not clearly outline the difference between the objectives of pdgs and pgs."
"while the objectives of each of these three programs are indicated online, the audit found that documentation does not clearly distinguish differences between the objectives of talent, insight and connection programs as they pertain to pdgs and pgs."
"program staff indicated that feedback received from applicants has, indeed, suggested that the objectives are confusing when applicants are deciding where to apply."
"given the similarity between the objectives of pg and pdg, there is a risk that applicants may not apply to the most appropriate grant, possibly reducing their chances of receiving funding."
clarity could be enhanced through the use of examples.
formal agreements are not required between primary institutions and their partners.
"a review of a sample of these agreements demonstrated that they were general in nature and did not outline specific obligations of the partners concerning standard research-related activities-i.e., professional conduct within the partnership, sharing of information, dissemination of research results or communicating with the media."
"while sshrc holds the primary institutions accountable for managing the partnership as a whole, inappropriate actions on the part of individual partners could still have consequences to sshrc-s reputation given that the partnership to which they belong is publically funded."
"for the sample of applications tested, all applications were confirmed to be eligible and therefore, appropriately proceeded to the adjudication phase."
"grant recommendations are sufficiently justified; however, limited feedback is provided to unsuccessful applicants."
the audit found that key controls have been implemented in the design of the adjudication process for both pdg and pg grants to facilitate robust assessment.
testing confirmed that applications were consistently assessed against these criteria and scales by the committee.
"testing also confirmed that the results of the adjudication process were documented, signed off by the necessary parties and final scores for each application supported the adjudication committees- funding recommendations."
"while the audit found that the assessment of applications was robust, unsuccessful applicants received varying levels of feedback, depending on the grant."
"it was noted that while unsuccessful pg applicants were provided with detailed feedback outlining areas of improvement, the same type of narrative feedback was not provided to unsuccessful pdg applicants."
"nevertheless, without narrative feedback, applicants may not get sufficient insight on the areas of improvement that could strengthen future pdg applications."
processes are in place to recruit appropriate adjudication committee members.
"as such, it is imperative that the program recruit appropriate committee members."
the appropriateness of the committee can be viewed on two levels.
"first, a committee must have the appropriate composition of members according to sshrc-s -manual for adjudication committee members 2015-16-. second, the individual members reviewing the applications should have the appropriate background and expertise."
"the audit noted that the program ensured that each adjudication committee maintained a balance of members with respect to gender, primary language, and geographic distribution."
"regarding the adjudication committee members, it was noted that the program did not have a formal assessment process to select members."
award payments are approved by the appropriate delegated authority.
"as per the review of the sample of successful grant applications, the audit found that all award decisions were approved by the appropriate section 32 delegated authorities."
"furthermore, the audit found that grant payment information that was entered in amis, the grant management system, matched the annual award approval document (which was also approved by the appropriate section 34 delegated authority) prior to the disbursement of funds to recipients."
"based on this assessment, the review committee recommends whether the program should continue or terminate the funding."
"a performance management strategy has been developed for the program, but has not yet been implemented."
"the audit found that program management had not yet defined their expectations for performance reporting (frequency, type of information, format, level of detail required etc.) to support effective decision-making."
"despite the absence of clearly articulated performance reporting expectations, it was noted that a performance management strategy (pms) had been developed for the program in april 2015."
"at the time of this audit, the pms had not yet been implemented."
"in the absence of systematic measurement and monitoring, data is not being fully leveraged to guide the identification of deficiencies and continuously improve the program."
"despite the complexities of this activity, the audit noted that the process was well documented and communicated."

"based on this assessment, the review committee recommends whether the program should continue or terminate the funding."
"a performance management strategy has been developed for the program, but has not yet been implemented."
"the audit found that program management had not yet defined their expectations for performance reporting (frequency, type of information, format, level of detail required etc.) to support effective decision-making."
"despite the absence of clearly articulated performance reporting expectations, it was noted that a performance management strategy (pms) had been developed for the program in april 2015."
"at the time of this audit, the pms had not yet been implemented."
"despite the complexities of this activity, the audit noted that the process was well documented and communicated."
"audit team chief audit executive: peter finnigan internal audit principal: john-patrick moore senior internal auditor: jack jin contractor: pricewaterhousecoopers llp appendix i - lines of enquiry, audit criteria and sources loe1: governance and risk management criterion #1: a governance framework has been established and oversight is provided by management to ensure objectives are met and risks are managed."
"(coso - control environment; ocg - g-1, g-2, ac-3) criterion #2: management has identified the risks that may preclude the achievement of program objectives and has developed mitigation strategies that are regularly reviewed and reported on."
"(coso - risk management; ocg - rm-2, rm-4, rm-5) loe 2: application and adjudication criterion #3: guidance and information are available and communicated to potential applicants prior to the grant submission process."
(coso - information and communication; ocg - ppl-4) criterion #4: control mechanisms have been established to ensure only eligible grant applications are assessed based on defined criteria.
management responses were provided and include: an action plan to address each recommendation; a lead responsible for implementation of the action plan; and a target date for completion of the implementation of the action plan.
"the results of the audit are organized into three sections: program oversight, eligibility assessment, and agreement monitoring and reporting."
program oversight program oversight informs management of impediments that may impact the achievement of program objectives.
"timely, accurate, and complete program information helps support program oversight and decision-making."
"the treasury board (tb) policy on transfer payments requires departments to -ensure that cost-effective oversight, internal controls, performance measurement, and reporting systems are in place to support the management of transfer payments-."
aggregate project information: sped-s management control framework for non-brm programs articulates the importance of identifying and addressing program issues.
"reporting was generally project specific (i.e. application information, project progress, budget forecasts, claim verification) and was used by program management to determine whether the applicant is eligible for funding and adhering to the terms and conditions of the contribution agreement."
"this information would help management identify key trends, systemic issues, and/or opportunities."
it is a tool for management to receive performance information at the program level and through the continual administration of the contribution agreements.
program management receives aggregate performance information annually and project specific performance information once the project is completed.
aggregate project reports should be developed to support decision-making.
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed. programs branch acknowledges the benefits of robust processes and systems that provide aggregate quantitative information to support program and project decision-making system project information as a basis for decision-making.
"the assurance systems stream, in consultation with the directorate-s program design and performance division and other branch directorates, will define business requirements for a more robust process and electronic/computer-based system for collecting, monitoring and reporting individual and aggregate assurance projects."
a process and electronic/computer-based system will be implemented once the business requirements are approved and adopted by the branch.
"lead responsible: adm, programs branch target date for completion: part a) june 2017 part b) december 2017 eligibility assessment the program assesses applications to determine whether they meet the eligibility requirements articulated in the terms and conditions of the program and the applicant guide."
this assessment provides the foundation for decision makers to accept or reject a proposed application and ensures that funding is allocated to projects that support the achievement of the program outcomes and objectives.
the program-s application assessment process is documented in a formal procedures manual and is supported by sped guidance material.
this process consists of three phases: phase 1 - preliminary screening: the program assesses an application to determine whether it meets the basic eligibility requirements.
this provides an early signal to the recipient on whether the application would be considered for funding.
the program uses a preliminary screening application form (developed by sped) to make a determination of whether the application is complete and eligible.
"in 10 sampled application files, the preliminary screening application form was used 90% (9 out of 10) of the time."
"in addition, the project screening application form was signed-off by program management 67% (6 out of 9) of the time."
"phase 2 - comprehensive assessment: once the applicant has met the basic eligibility requirements, a thorough assessment of the application against the eligibility requirements within the terms and conditions and the application guide is conducted."
"this assessment includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the project activities, the applicant-s capabilities, and the application-s merit."
this phase also involves consulting subject matter experts on areas of market need and strategic importance.
the results of this assessment are summarized in the project recommendation form.
this form is used by program management to recommend the approval or rejection of an application.
"sped-s guidance on the use of the form requires that the program document whether the project has met all essential assessment criteria, to identify any concerns, and to state whether the application is recommended for approval or rejection."
documenting the eligibility assessment of an application is a core component of a transfer payment program as it demonstrates sound stewardship in the use of public resources.
recording how and why a decision is made ensures decision-makers are aware of the sufficiency and/or limitations of the assessment.
recommendation 2 - documentation of eligibility assessments the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should review documentation requirements for the eligibility assessment of applications to strengthen the decision-making process.
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed. programs branch recognizes the importance of documenting decision-making related to project applications and assessments.
programs branch will undertake a review of documentation requirements and identify and implement improvements that would help to strengthen the assessment and decision-making process.
"lead responsible: adm, programs branch target date for completion: june 2017 phase 3 - application approval: once the project recommendation form is finalized, the program presents the proposed application at the dg project review committee for discussion and decision."
these members played an important role in ensuring that recommended applications support the achievement of program objectives and outcomes.
terms of reference specified that three aafc dg members are required for decision.
clarifying quorum and information requirements would further strengthen the discussions that occur.
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
these monitoring activities help ensure: proper administration of public funds; compliance with contribution agreements; projects remain aligned with performance targets; and provide early warning to the program of issues that could impact the success of the project.
the result of the assessment generates a monitoring strategy for the program to implement.
project monitoring: the project monitoring strategy outlines the mitigating measures that the program puts in place to ensure that projects successfully meet their stated objective.
"the monitoring strategy sets out a number of requirements, such as: the amount of holdback, frequency and type of monitoring, the percentage of invoices that should be sampled during the claim verification, the frequency of project progress and financial reporting."
the monitoring strategy requirements were applied as follows: out of 10) of sampled approved project files had work plan progress reports as required; and out of 10) of sampled approved project files following the sampling requirements for claim verification as required.
"without this analysis, the program-s ability to assess its performance may be limited."
management response and action plan management response and action plan: agreed.
the findings of this review will form the basis for recommendations and actions to strengthen agreement monitoring and reporting.
performance processes are in place to communicate recipient performance information to key decision makers.
"summarized information on the results / progress of recipient projects are provided to management in a timely, accurate, complete and useful manner."
service standards are communicated to program management on a regular basis.
"controls are in place to support fair, transparent and free of bias decisions."
recipients comply with the terms and conditions of the program.
payments made to recipients accurately reflect funding agreements.
"the following sections present the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit, and provides recommendations for improvement."
"to assess this expectation, the audit sought to confirm that the program has processes in place to inform senior management of risk, project and performance information."
program risk information: the program uses sped-s program risk management tool to assess program level risks.
the annual risk assessment is conducted based on the expectations outlined in aafc-s integrated program risk management directive (2012).
"the risk assessment approach considers key aspects of the program, including but not limited to: materiality, complexity, program design, program administration, and performance measurement."
"the outcome of the program risk assessment advises program management of potential areas that may impede the achievement of program objectives, so that these areas are appropriately managed to mitigate the likelihood of occurrence and impact."
"the audit noted that the program is collecting quantitative information that would be useful during the assessment of program risk, such as: service standards targets, project level risk scores, claim processing information, and project progress information."
the use of quantitative information would further support the program-level risk assessments.
"there is an opportunity for the program to compile aggregate program level analysis and reports using the information already collected (i.e. project risk information, project progress, and claim information)."
performance information: the program performance measurement and risk management strategy (ppmrms) is a program design document that outlines the performance measurement strategy and performance reporting requirements.
the audit found that the program complied with the reporting commitments noted in the ppmrms.
"recommendation 1 - program level reporting the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should review and strengthen the systems in place to support program level reporting, in particular: quantitative program information should be incorporated into program-level risk assessments to help inform the identification of issues and decision-making; including action plans to mitigate identified risks, as appropriate."
the assurance systems stream will review existing program-level risk assessment processes against service and program excellence directorate-s program risk management control framework for non-brm programs requirements and make the necessary adjustments to ensure quantitative program information is incorporated into program-level risk assessments where information is available and where appropriate.
"the tb policy on information management as related to the tb policy on transfer payments requires that -decisions and decision-making processes are documented to account for and support the continuity of departmental operations, permit the reconstruction of the evolution of policies and programs, and allow for independent evaluation, audit and review.- based on this expectation, the audit sought to confirm that the activities undertaken by the program to assess applications were documented in the project files and reviewed by management."
interviews with program officers and management indicated that this formal review of the form is often supplemented by informal meetings.
"in 10 sampled application files, the audit found that neither the application file, nor the project recommendation form, had sufficiently documented the assessment to support the decision made by the program."
"specifically: out of 10) of application files did not contain the program assessment on whether the application will affect the sector, and if the proposed activities and costs were eligible and reasonable to meet the program objectives; out of 10) of application files did not contain the program-s assessment on the applicant-s capacity to complete the proposed project and whether the application activities support the program objectives; and out of 10) of application files did not contain the program-s assessment on whether the proposed project can demonstrate a current or potential market opportunity and whether the project fits within the department-s current priorities."
the audit found that the form would have benefited from additional information on the assessment process and whether the project met all essential eligibility criteria.
"as a result, the information being relayed to decision makers via the form may not provide sufficient information to facilitate a thorough discussion and recommendation."
"discussions with program management and officers confirmed that, once the form is drafted, informal meetings were held between the program manager, director, and director general to challenge and review application information."
"the audit noted there is an opportunity to formally document this review (i.e. through signature, notes from management, and/or correspondence) to further strengthen the assessments made by the program."
the committee is composed of dg level members from across aafc and cfia as appropriate.
"in the application files sampled, the audit found that the decision made by the dg project review committee to recommend approval or rejection was documented."
"however, the audit noted that quorum was not realized 57% of the time (13 out of 23 meetings) as the required members did not regularly attend meetings."
recommendation 3 - terms of reference for dg review committee the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should review the director general project review committee-s terms of reference to ensure that information and quorum requirements are appropriate for program needs.
"the assurance systems stream will review the terms of reference and propose modifications to the dg review committee to ensure that information and quorum requirements are appropriate for program needs; and, that they are clearly documented."
"lead responsible: adm, programs branch target date for completion: january 2017 agreement monitoring and reporting once the application is approved by the appropriate delegate and a contribution agreement is awarded, the program is required to monitor the project."
"the tb policy on transfer payments requires that -administrative requirements on applicants and recipients, which are required to ensure effective control, transparency and accountability, are proportionate to the level of risks specific to the program, the materiality of funding, and to the risk profile of applicants and recipients-."
"based on this expectation, the audit sought to confirm that the program had assessed project risks and developed a monitoring strategy to mitigate these risks."
recipient / project risk assessments: each approved application is risk assessed using aafc-s recipient / project risk management framework (rprmf).
"in 10 sampled approved projects, the audit found that projects were risk assessed annually using the rprmf and that the monitoring strategies were generated."
"the audit noted that there is an opportunity for the program to improve the support used during the assessment of recipient and project risk to include information that is gathered during the administration of the project, such as: site visits, financial statements, board meeting minutes, organizational structure, recipient policies and procedures, as well as internal process documentation."
the audit found that this expectation was not applied for the 10 sampled projects.
"in particular, two risk categories (i.e. management control framework and financial management) had insufficient information on file; however their risk ratings were assessed as low or medium low."
"as a result, the monitoring strategy that the program implemented may not identify project risks and/or issues that may impede the achievement of the project objectives in a timely basis."
"in the sample of 10 approved projects, the audit found that monitoring strategies conformed to the risk rating assigned and that this strategy was signed-off by program management."
ensuring monitoring activities are documented would support program management to ensure that project key risks are appropriately mitigated.
"recipient / project performance: in addition to the sample of 10 approved project files, the audit sampled 4 out of 9 (44%) completed projects to determine whether final performance reports were reviewed by management and whether projects were assessed based on the expectations within the contribution agreement."
the audit found that 100% (4 out of 4) completed projects had performance reports that were signed off by appropriate delegates.
the audit also observed that there was no documented analysis on file to indicate whether the projects successfully met the stated objectives.
"recommendation 4 - recipient /project monitoring and performance assessment the assistant deputy minister of programs branch should review documentation requirements for the project risk assessment, program monitoring activities and the assessment of the recipient / project performance to strengthen agreement monitoring and reporting."
"the assurance systems stream, in consultation with the directorate-s program design and reporting division, will conduct a business process review of existing tools and processes related to project risk assessment, program monitoring activities and the assessment of recipient project performance against aafc-s recipient / project risk management framework (rprmf)."
"in the interim, assurance systems stream will formally communicate the expectations to program officers for documenting project risk assessments, program monitoring activities, and the assessment of recipient / project performance."
"lead(s) responsible: adm, programs branch target date for completion: june 2017 annex a: audit criteria program management receive sufficient and timely recipient information for decision making."
a formal risk management process is implemented within the program.
recipient eligibility is assessed and appropriately documented recipients are assessed for eligibility using established criteria which are based on the program-s terms and conditions.
funding agreements are aligned with recipient and initiative risk.
recipient compliance to the program terms and conditions and the funding agreement is monitored and issues are addressed when indicated.
"audit results are derived from examination of documentation, interviews conducted and file review."
"the audit team reviewed key documentation including relevant policies and guidance, strategic and planning documents, performance reports, and committee terms of references and minutes."
"the team conducted 36 group and individual interviews with employees involved in mnch programming across the department at headquarters (hq), and in missions, in person and via videoconference."
it also interviewed two recipient organizations.
the file review was comprised of 26 project files and covered 42 transactions.
"the audit team also took into consideration the department-s mnch formative evaluation which covered the first four years of the muskoka initiative, from 2010-11 to 2013-14."
"governance and accountabilities the audit team examined whether a governance structure is established and provides oversight and strategic direction for the mnch commitments. we also examined whether accountabilities, authorities, and responsibilities are clearly defined, documented and communicated to key department stakeholders."
"governance structure and oversight the 2015 mandate letter to the minister of international development and la francophonie committed to a government that is accountable to canadians, that tracks the results and reports on the progress toward fulfilling the department-s commitments."
the audit team expected to find an established governance structure providing oversight over the mnch commitments to ensure effective coordination and to support decision-making.
"to do so, the audit team examined documentation and interviewed key personnel for both the muskoka initiative and the renewed commitment."
"within mfm, the health and nutrition bureau (mnd) is the focal point for mnch strategic policy, advice and analysis on the status of the commitments."
"with the executive board at the strategic and decision-making level, the following key committees oversee the implementation of the mnch commitments: oversight level programs committee - the mandate of this committee is to ensure consistency and rigor in program design, delivery and performance across all the programs of the department, with particular reference to grants and contributions programs funded by the international assistance envelope."
the programs committee is chaired by the assistant deputy minister (adm) of mfm and its members cover a variety of programs.
"the committee provides leadership, guidance and advice on programming issues for the department; monitors the department-s implementation of international programming commitments from a strategic perspective; and advances coherence between programs and policy, including thematic areas of focus."
"resource management committee - the mandate of this committee is to provide strategic direction and oversight on the alignment of financial, non-financial and human resources with departmental priorities."
asia-pacific (ogm) chairs the committee.
the resource management committee oversees the alignment of investment planning against departmental priorities and the international financial assistance commitments.
"assistant deputy minister mnch committee - an adm committee, which consists of all adms with mnch responsibilities, meets on an ad hoc basis."
it is chaired by mfm.
discussions and issues raised in the mnch working group and dg ad-hoc committee are brought up to the adm committee for decision-making.
"operational level director general programs committee (dgpc) - the mandate of this committee is to facilitate coherent and effective programming practices, and consider issues related to programming coherence and effectiveness."
"the committee provides advice to the evaluation committee, resource management committee and programs committee."
"it is responsible for overseeing the whole-of-department implementation of international programming key deliverables and deadlines, and providing updates on key operational and coherence practices."
this forum serves in sharing information regarding the mnch commitments.
"director general mnch committee - an ad hoc dg mnch committee, which consists of dgs with mnch responsibilities, meets on an ad hoc basis to address key issues related to the mnch commitments."
"working level mnch working group - from october 2014 to july 2015, an informal mnch working group led by geographic coordination and mission support division (nmd) provided communication and coordination across branches on mnch programming."
"in january 2016, an mnch departmental working group was formed as a formal consultative forum intended to improve coordination amongst relevant branches working on canada-s $3.5 billion mnch commitment (2015-2020) and to ensure coherent advice and effective implementation of activities and reporting related to mnch."
"the working group is chaired by maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition division (mnc), joined by up to two members of each programming branch with mnch responsibilities (kfm, mfm, ogm, ngm, and wgm)."
the records of decisions for the programs committee showed that the last documented discussion on mnch was dated january 2014.
"furthermore, while there was a discussion regarding the performance data for international development, which links to mnch, no records of follow-up actions or decisions were found."
"for the same period, while both the dgpc and dg committee were used as information sharing forums, records of decisions showed that updates on the mnch were only provided at four dgpc meetings."
other documentation reviewed showed limited management control over the status and progress of the mnch commitments.
"considering the significance of mnch, a documented decision-making is important to demonstrate the existence of oversight, and to ensure evidence of the provision of strategic direction."
it provided coordination and communicated key information.
"as mentioned, the new mnch departmental working group replaced the previous informal mnch working group in january 2016, but, meetings have been held infrequently."
the audit team was advised that the cause of the infrequent meetings is attributable to a high turnover rate of staff within mnd.
"accountability, roles and responsibilities clearly established roles and responsibilities are essential for ensuring that effective program implementation, monitoring and reporting requirements are met. in order to support the effective delivery of the mnch programming and projects, the audit team expected to find defined accountabilities for the mnch commitments, that are in line with roles and responsibilities, and that are shared with employees."
"the treasury board (tb) -instructions to departments for developing a management, resources, and results structure (mrrs)- indicates that the responsibility position has overall responsibility for overseeing the program and for collecting and assessing its actual versus its expected results."
"in july 2016, the new tb policy on results replaced the tb policy on mrrs."
the essence of the policy remains unchanged as compared to previous versions.
"according to the tb policy on results, the department is required to designate an official who is responsible for establishing, implementing and maintaining program performance information and ensure its data collection."
"the departmental program alignment architecture (paa) identifies the director general of social development (mgd) and director general of health and nutrition (mnd), within mfm, as the responsibility positions for mnch."
"in this role, mfm is expected to collect and assess mnch performance information against expected results."
"in conclusion, while governance structure and different levels of committees were established, improvements are required in clarifying and communicating roles and responsibilities to ensure cohesion and coordination of the renewed mnch commitment."
"as well, the responsibility for reporting on mnch performance needs to be clarified and communicated to all departmental mnch stakeholders."
"recommendation #1: the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development should: clarify accountability and responsibilities for department-wide mnch commitments, especially for performance reporting; and ensure that coordination and communication with all departmental mnch stakeholders takes place on a regular basis."
delivery of the mnch commitments the audit team examined whether mnch programming is designed to support the delivery of the commitments and whether mnch projects were delivered according to applicable authorities and policies.
the audit team also examined if controls in place ensure that the management of grants and contributions for the mnch commitments are in line with applicable policies and legislation.
"project planning and approval process since 2013, the planning and approval process for all development projects of the department has followed the authorized programming process (app), the department-s standardized approach to programming aid initiatives, from the planning phase to implementation."
"mnch projects are delivered through multilateral or bilateral investments or co-investments in partners- initiatives, and within the branches- existing programming."
projects are managed either at headquarters or at missions.
projects decentralized to missions are managed by the program officers located in decentralized country programs and supported by their hq counterparts.
"specifically, the six programming branches each completed an exercise of program and project planning in line with agreed notional allocations."
"within the branches- authorities and with respect to their own funding channels, development programs submitted investment plans to senior management for their respective division."
for example: geographic country programs planned bilateral investments in line with their country strategies; kfm launched a call for proposals to work with canadian organizations; and mfm renewed and signed agreements with international organizations.
funding allocation was discussed in adm meetings and presented to the minister of international development for approval.
"for both mnch commitments, each programming branch was allocated a portion of the mnch funds and given a specific disbursement target for the five-year period."
better communication of the funding allocation process and resulting decisions would allow branches to plan their resources more effectively.
"recommendation #2: the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development, in collaboration with kfm and geographic branches, should communicate the process and decisions with regard to mnch funding allocations to program staff for effective planning of their resources."
"project management and controls pertaining to applicable policies and the authorized programming process the audit team assessed the project management practices and controls in place for the delivery of the mnch commitments by examining a sample of 26 mnch projects managed from both headquarters and missions, and by the six programming branches involved with mnch."
the app is the standardized process used by the department and it has embedded controls within each phase of the project lifecycle.
"the audit team examined this process in assessing decisions made and documentation in place for the project planning, due diligence, agreement structure, terms of payment, eligibility and accuracy of expenditures, as well as monitoring requirements and practices."
"as well, project activities and expected results were described in the agreement respectively for 92% and 88% of the projects examined."
the auditors- analysis of the financial transactions concluded that financial management was sound and that controls were consistently applied to ensure that the funds were spent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and with relevant policies.
"furthermore, the testing of the eligibility and accuracy of expenditures revealed that all were eligible costs, and in line with the approved budget."
all expenditures were incurred once the agreement was signed and during the period claimed.
"also, all expenditures reviewed for professional services and travel covered completed activities and for which a contract was properly granted."
expenditures examined represented accurate amounts and were accurately reported in the financial system (sap).
"finally, all travel expenses analyzed in our sample were in compliance with the department-s travel policy and 100% of the sampled expenses were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the signed agreement."
the initiative assessment gives explicit assurance that financial and contracting officers exercised due diligence in financial and contracting matters.
"in addition, for the projects at the implementation stage, 20% of files reviewed were missing reporting documentation."
"this matters because almost all of these gaps refer to contribution agreements, which are conditional transfer payments."
the department-s due diligence reference guide for program managers states that program officers and managers at hq and in the field are all bound by the elements of the due diligence process.
they work together to ensure that all of the elements of due diligence are addressed throughout the life cycle of any project or program.
the work plan includes a list of pre-determined steps and tasks.
maintaining the work plan and updating the planned activities and actual dates is required.
"program officers can refer to the work plan to update the program manager, director or team of the project progress."
keeping the work plan current also facilitates resource forecasting for all team members.
"therefore, according to the work plan in the system, it is not clear whether the project milestones were achieved."
"improvement in retaining project documentation is needed to avoid inefficient work or duplication of effort that may occur due to the time associated with searching for documents or the effort spent on preparing the documentation again, when needed."
"given the departmental context of employee mobility and rotation, where projects may be managed by a number of program officers throughout their lifecycle, complete documentation will ensure efficiency and evidence of due diligence and retention of corporate memory."
"recommendation #3: the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development, in collaboration with kfm and geographic branches, should ensure that due diligence with regard to mnch projects is exercised and that key documentation is retained."
"guidance, tools and capacity supporting the delivery of mnch the audit team assessed whether tools and guidance were developed to support the delivery of the mnch commitments in a consistent manner."
"support for the delivery of mnch programs and projects program officers manage development projects, including mnch."
"they rely on the expertise of thematic specialists, including gender equality and health specialists at hq and through locally engaged staff based at missions and consultants that work at project support units (field support services), to assist them in the assessment of proposals and review of project performance reports."
"further to the field-based specialist support, kfm and other programming branches rely on program officers and locally engaged staff to review proposals, monitor projects and bring partners together to ensure effective knowledge management."
decentralized geographic programs manage programming directly from the field.
"field officers have equal need for support in tools and training as their hq counterparts, but will have different access to training and resources than hq colleagues."
"at hq, mnch programming staff has limited support from health specialists; there are four within the department that provide support to all development programs, including mnch."
having the support from a specialist is one way to obtain expert capacity to deliver the mnch programming.
"another is to acquire knowledge through guidance, tools and training."
"guidance and tools mnch is a global affairs canada-s international development commitment and as such, follows standardized procedures."
development projects are managed according to the department-s app.
guidance and tools have been developed in support of the app.
"review of documentation identified that the policies, programming process, guidance, tools and templates are available online."
"as well, terms and conditions for international development assistance, a set of parameters under which transfer payments may be made for a given transfer payment program, are also available online."
"at the time of the audit, progress was being made to renew some of the guidance to bring it in line with the new commitment to reflect the new minister-s priorities."
"for example, definitions on sexual and reproductive health rights were prepared to address the new department priorities."
"as well, guiding frameworks for maternal and child health were drafted."
"therefore, without up-to-date and consistent guidance, program officers reported that they do not have all the tools they need to develop programming for the mnch commitments."
"in addition to the corporate investment guides for app and pre-app projects, a coding guide was developed by the department to help program officers capture all reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (rmnch) spending by development partners and to track rmnch resource flows."
coding investments provides the department with accurate data for reporting and decision-making purposes.
adequate tools and guidance would enhance knowledge and skills required of program officers to effectively manage the mnch projects.
training the department offers a number of training opportunities to program officers and other staff members through the canadian foreign service institute (cfsi) and the canada school of public service (csps).
training notices are posted on the department-s intranet in the training and learning section and they are communicated via broadcast messages to all employees on a regular basis.
"for example, partnerships for innovation (kfm) organized an orientation session in preparation for the assessment regarding the call for proposals."
"sub-saharan africa (wgm) and asia-pacific (ogm) have also hosted a few information sessions regarding human rights, gender equality and ongoing initiatives."
mnd assisted with organizing an internal and external learning event related to the findings of the formative evaluation of the mnch.
"some program officers and health specialists expressed a need and an interest for more mnch training, such as training on mnch coding, and refreshers to keep current in the areas of health and nutrition."
"recommendation #4: the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development should: develop tools and guidance for mnch program officers to assist them in mnch programming; and in collaboration with the chief financial officer, provide necessary training on mnch coding to ensure completeness and consistency in data reporting."
"mnch financial performance monitoring to ensure that a grant and contribution program is managed and delivered consistently, controls for performance monitoring and reporting must be in place to measure progress towards planned results."
the audit examined whether the department-s financial information was collected to track the progress of mnch.
a review of documents showed that reports are produced on a monthly and quarterly basis to keep track of and to report on the financial results of the mnch commitment.
the auditors also reviewed two annual reports that present a summary of international assistance activities: the report to parliament on the government of canada-s official development assistance and the statistical report on international assistance.
these two reports consist mostly of financial performance information.
"mnch project performance monitoring according to the app, the project team leader should monitor actual performance against planned results on an ongoing basis to ensure that the project is on track."
"as well, at the outset of each project, it is important to establish performance objectives, targets, and indicators."
this is done through the development of two tools: the logic model and the performance measurement framework (pmf).
the file review of select projects showed that logic models and pmfs were developed for 100% of the projects examined.
"as well, evidence that performance reports and audit reports were reviewed by project team leaders was found on file for almost all projects, respectively 86% and 89%."
"similarly, our file review showed that program officers have analyzed and documented all instances where significant variance related to progress was observed and where unplanned events occurred."
"finally, a management summary report, summarizing the project performance, was completed for all implemented projects."
"mnch performance management strategy and reporting according to the tb policy on transfer payments, the department is required to establish a performance measurement strategy (pm strategy) for a transfer payment program, such as mnch, at the time of program design, and ensure that it is maintained and updated throughout the life cycle of the program."
"to report on the 2010-2015 muskoka initiative, mfm developed a performance management strategy (pms), including a performance measurement framework (pmf) and logic model."
some program officers use indicators from the 2010-2015 pmf to support the development of their projects and while others use the draft version of the 2015-2020 pmf.
"it may also impact the ability of senior management to make fully informed decisions across all projects, programs and elements of the mnch commitments and to manage them in a timely and comprehensive manner."
the audit team-s review of documentation found that examples of project-level results were collected and reported to senior management.
"for the children and youth sub-program, which includes mnch, instead of reporting results, the department reported on the number of programs and projects contributing to the performance results."
this process involves a manual roll-up of data and a significant commitment of resources.
these challenges affect the department-s efficiency in data collection and reporting.
"recommendation #5: the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development, in collaboration with kfm and geographic branches, should finalize and approve a performance management strategy that includes a results framework and performance indicators for the current mnch commitment to measure results for reporting."
"as well, the assistant deputy minister, global issues and development, in collaboration with kfm and geographic branches, should implement a more efficient reporting mechanism that allows for a consolidation of mnch performance results across the department."
"at the project level, management practices and controls were established and implemented; project monitoring and reporting practices were strong; financial management was sound and controls were consistently applied; and funds were spent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreements."
opportunities for improvement were noted in the areas of: operational-level oversight; responsibility for reporting; communication of funding allocation; document retention; capacity building; and performance management.
"appendix a: about the audit objective the objective of this audit was to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the management control framework over the mnch commitments and its delivery, including projects managed at headquarters and those decentralized in missions abroad."
"scope the audit examined the operating procedures, processes, and controls in place for the management and delivery of the mnch program for both headquarters administered and decentralized projects."
the audit covered both mnch commitments: 2010-2015 (mnch 1.0) and 2015-2020 (mnch 2.0).
"more specifically, the audit covered the last year of mnch 1.0 and the first year of mnch 2.0."
criteria sub-criteria governance and accountability are clearly defined and communicated to support the delivery of the mnch commitments.
a governance structure is established and provides oversight and strategic direction for the mnch commitments.
"accountabilities, authorities, and responsibilities are clearly defined, documented and communicated to key department stakeholders in a timely manner. mnch projects are delivered and administered according to applicable authorities and policies in support of the mnch objectives."
"controls are in place, including fraud controls, and applied to ensure that grant and contribution management is in compliance with the requirements of the financial administration act, the treasury board policy on transfer payments and with other applicable policies."
mnch commitments and project performance reporting supports informed decision-making.
"approach and methodology the audit of the mnch commitments was in accordance with treasury board policy on internal audit, directives, and the internal audit standards for the government of canada and conforms to the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing of the institute of internal auditors."
"in order to conclude on the above criteria and report against the audit objective, the following methods were used: identify and review relevant policies, directives, and guidance; review and analyze documentation including financial and non-financial information; perform walk-throughs of key controls and processes; interview key mnch personnel at hq and in selected missions (including video and tele conferences); and analyze management practices from selected missions and review both centralized and decentralized mnch projects."
"select projects the audit tested key controls and processes for selected projects that, for the period of april 2014 and march 2016, were either operational or terminating for mnch 1.0, and approved for mnch 2.0, (see table below)."
"for the last year of mnch 1.0, projects selected were drawn from the new funding of $1.1 billion for the muskoka commitment and excluded projects from the existing baseline funding."
"the reason for this is that the new funding focused on the programming objectives agreed to in the 2010 g8 summit: strengthening health systems; improving nutrition for mothers, newborns and children; and reducing the disease burden."
"also, to ensure that aid was focused and could deliver maximum results, the muskoka funding was primarily allocated to ten countries of focus with high rates of maternal and child mortality."
"in addition, global affairs canada was responsible for programming all of the projects under the new funding, whereas for the baseline funding, other government departments were also responsible for programming."
the 26 projects selected for file review are listed in appendix b.
"based on this work, observations and recommendations were developed under the themes of: governance and accountability; delivery and administration; guidance, tools and capacity; and performance management and reporting."
"the review of documentation indicated that programming for mnch is delivered through existing departmental program structures; mfm is the policy, thematic coordination and communication lead for the mnch commitments."
"the audit team found that, for both the muskoka initiative and the renewed mnch commitment, a governance structure and different levels of committees were in place to ensure oversight."
the audit noted that different levels of committees were established.
"similarly, at the operational level, the audit team found some evidence of meeting documentation from august 2015 to september 2016."
"at the working level, interviews with program officers and management indicated that the informal mnch working group worked well and included all key mnch stakeholders in the department."
program officers and management interviewed had mixed views regarding the effectiveness of the communication of decisions: some interviewees indicated that information-sharing worked well while many others felt that information sharing could be improved by providing timely documentation.
"this responsibility for overall reporting was also confirmed by the corporate planning, performance and risk management bureau (srd)."
"however, the audit team was advised by mnch programming branches that they each are accountable for reporting on mnch results at the project level."
"at the departmental level, there is a lack of clarity with regard to accountability for reporting on the mnch commitments."
"thus, there is a risk that the department cannot demonstrate the progress and results of the renewed mnch commitment and report on the achievement of departmental development priorities."
"a review of documentation and interviews with key personnel indicated that for the muskoka initiative, there were clear funding allocations for each of the ten country programs; however the project selection and resource allocation under the renewed commitment were done through the department-s investment planning process."
the audit team found evidence of a fund allocation approach for both mnch commitments.
"for the 2010-2015 commitment, mnch program staff interviewed indicated that they were aware of the branch targets and that there was a process for funding allocation."
"overall, the file review confirmed that project management practices and controls were generally both established and implemented according to applicable policies and the app."
"the audit team came to this conclusion based on the following observations of the project files examined: a standard template was used to prepare the agreement in 100% of the projects; 100% of the files included a payment schedule, and eligible costs were defined in 94% of the cases."
"for project risk assessments, the file review demonstrated that the programs were in compliance with the requirements."
"for example, the audit tests confirmed that forms for consultation with gender equality and environment specialists were found on file for 96% of the projects, and a form for the fiduciary risk assessment tool (fret) was found for 95% of the files examined."
the audit team-s review of project files demonstrated that improvements are needed to better document decisions.
"while all 26 projects had a grant or contribution agreement that was signed by the appropriate authority, 36% of these projects- approved initiative assessments were not found on file."
"similarly, in 19% of the sampled projects, the audit team did not find evidence on file that a contracting officer reviewed the approval memo."
"based on the app requirements, each project must be entered in the grants and contributions system (gcs) and have a work plan created."
the file review indicated that all projects assessed in our sample were entered into the gcs.
"however, none of the work plans were updated with actual dates of completion."
"to conclude, the audit team found that project management practices and controls were generally established and implemented according to applicable policies and the app; and that financial management was sound."
"however, the file review showed weaknesses in retention of key documents."
"furthermore, the documentation is evidence of sufficient work completed to meet the requirements of the project."
we also examined whether mnch capacity was appropriately designed to support the delivery of the mnch commitments.
the audit team found that there is limited guidance developed specifically for the mnch commitments.
"for example, guides were prepared on how to capture key performance indicators and on the reporting of results but these tools date back to 2013 and are not up-to-date with the renewed commitment (2015-2020)."
"however, this guidance has yet to be finalized and shared within the department."
"although this guide was put in place, interviews with program officers and managers indicated a disparity in the level of awareness of guidance and tools related to mnch coding."
"coding provides information about how the investments are categorized based on elements such as mnch sectors, business delivery models, investment attributes, and geographic scope."
"departmental staff has access to a variety of courses, related to project management such as risk management, result-based management, and gender equality in programming."
the audit team-s review of documentation and online training indicated that the csps and the cfsi course catalogues do not include courses on health programming nor on mnch-specific subjects.
"this is particularly important in the context of staff mobility and rotation, where program officers, who may not necessarily possess a background in mnch programming, change positions on a regular basis and need to become familiar with the subject matters they are assigned to work on."
"without mnch-specific training to support the delivery of the mnch commitment, program officers may not have the support they need to discharge their responsibilities related to mnch projects."
performance measurement and reporting the audit team examined performance reporting activities to determine whether they support informed decision-making with regard to the achievement of the mnch commitments. we also examined whether a performance measurement strategy was in place for the commitments and if performance information was sufficient and appropriately documented to track progress against the expected results.
the audit team found that the department has mechanisms and tools in place that help manage and closely monitor the mnch disbursements.
"overall, the file review indicated that project monitoring and reporting practices are strong."
a pm strategy assists in: ensuring that adequate and relevant information supports the program monitoring for results; making informed decisions and taking appropriate timely action; and providing effective departmental reporting.
"however, at the time of the audit, the pms for $3.5 billion for the 2015-2020 period had yet to be finalized and approved."
"in the absence of a formal pms, the department-s achievements may not be fully accounted for and reporting information available may be limited for the department to report on results achieved on mnch commitments."
this inconsistent use of indicators could result in difficulties in rolling up performance information.
"however, at the departmental level, no performance results for the mnch commitment were reported in 2014-2015."
"with regard to internal performance reporting, the audit team found limited documentation with the exception of one progress report prepared in 2013 linked to the first mnch commitment."
the audit noted that some branches took the initiative of compiling results and preparing progress reports for their own purposes and needs.
"collecting sufficient performance information would contribute to the new priority of accountability for results, which is one focus of the 2015-2020 mnch commitment."
"conclusion despite the mnch commitments- complexity and magnitude, the audit team noted that a governance structure and different levels of committees were established, and that mnch financial performance was monitored and reported."
"criteria the following criteria were developed based on the controls expected to be in place to manage high risk areas, and are designed to conclude on the audit objective within the defined audit scope."
"policies, procedures, guidance and tools are in place and support the delivery of the mnch commitments in a consistent manner. mnch programming and capacity are appropriately designed to support the delivery of the mnch commitments."
"mnch performance information, financial and non-financial, is sufficient and appropriately documented to track progress against goals and objectives."
"the audit examined governance, policy frameworks, and internal controls over financial management in place at the cs and reviewed a judgmental sample of 159 transactions for a total dollar value of $1,068,253 from the following expenditures and processes (see appendix c for details): procurement of goods and services, including acquisition cards; travel, hospitality, conference and event expenditures; salaries for casual employees; and overtime."
governance and policy framework for financial management establishing a governance and policy framework and defining roles and responsibilities over financial management provides an organization with the ability to design and implement sound financial management practices.
"the cs has a governing body comprised by three canadian commissioners, one of whom is the chair, who provide oversight over financial management alongside the secretary."
"this oversight function is mainly exercised through the monthly financial reporting, which provide opportunities to review and discuss budget and spending."
"furthermore, the commissioners are regularly informed of overall financial situation, including budget updates from the glro during the international joint commission executive meetings."
"the cs has established and implemented a suite of policies, directives, guidelines and tools to support sound financial management."
"it should be noted that the cs is considered a micro-organisation and is an entity listed under schedule iv of the financial administration act, and, as a result, it is not required to adopt all treasury board secretariat (tbs) policy suite."
roles and responsibilities in regards to financial management are clearly defined and understood.
"recommendation 1: the secretary of the canadian section of the international joint commission should, to the extent possible for a binational organization, consider establishing and implementing a policy of proactive disclosure for contracts over $10,000 as well as travel and hospitality expenses incurred by senior officials."
"internal controls the audit examined a sample of 159 transactions to ensure that core controls are operating effectively and resulted in compliance with the key requirements contained in policies, directives and corresponding legislation tested."
appendix c provides details of the sampled transactions.
"accordingly, the delegation of financial signing authorities matrix is signed by the minister of foreign affairs."
"the audit reviewed the operational processes and procedures and found that core controls are in place for expenditure initiation, commitment, verification and payment including segregation of duties."
"furthermore, account verification and quality assurance were performed before approving and processing payments."
"travel, hospitality and conferences expenditures the audit team expected to find that travel, hospitality and conference expenses were properly authorized, verified and had the required supporting documents prior to payment in accordance with: the cs-s directive on travel, hospitality, conference and event expenditures; the cs-s established delegated authorities; and the tbs authorized allowances."
travel travel shall be pre-authorized in writing to ensure that all travel arrangements are in compliance with the provisions of the directive.
"travellers must also forward for approval their travel expense claim, along with all supporting documents, including original receipts and an explanation for any deviation from the directive."
all travel expense claims should be processed in accordance with the delegation of financial signing authorities.
"the audit team reviewed a sample of 38 travel claims and found that, overall: travel was properly pre-authorized; and, travel expense claims were processed in accordance with the established delegated authorities and the directive on travel, hospitality, conference and event expenditures."
"conferences conferences and events are subject to pre-approval, spending and payment authorities in accordance with cs-s established delegated authorities."
"all 18 conferences claims examined were pre-authorized and, spending and payment authorities were exercised in accordance with cs-s established delegated authorities."
"procurement of goods and services the cs has chosen to comply with the tbs contracting policy, which requires that contracting practices result in openness, fairness and transparency in the spending of public funds."
"as well, the justifications for contract amendments were always on file."
"finally, contracts were reviewed and approved properly."
"in addition, in few instances, the work was performed after contract expiry date or before an amendment was issued."
"finally, the audit team examined a sample of 24 transactions from a bank acquisition card to ensure purchases were in accordance with policy requirements and were certified prior to payment."
"furthermore, acquisition card purchases were reconciled against monthly statements by the cardholder prior to certification and payment."
"recommendation2: the secretary of the canadian section of the international joint commission should enhance employees- awareness of policy and documentation requirements with regard to contracting activities, travel and hospitality expenditures, to ensure continued consistency and rigor in these processes."
"as well, core controls over financial management are in place and resulted in compliance with the key requirements contained in the policies, directives and corresponding legislation tested as part of the audit."
"appendix a: about the audit objective the objective of this audit was to provide reasonable assurance that core controls over financial management at the canadian section of the international joint commission were operating effectively and resulted in compliance with the key requirements of applicable legislations, regulations, and tbs and ijc policies."
"scope the scope of this audit included financial transactions, records and processes conducted by the cs in fiscal years 2014-15 and 2015-16."
"the audit examined governance, policy frameworks, and internal controls over financial management in place at sc. the audit also examined a sample of transactions for the following selected expenditures categories and processes: procurement of goods and services including acquisition cards; travel, hospitality, conference and event expenditures; salaries for casual employees; and overtime."
the audit criteria were discussed and agreed upon with the auditees.
the detailed criteria are presented as follows.
criteria the governance and oversight structures are effective and roles and responsibilities are clearly articulated and communicated to support sound financial governance and management.
policy framework is developed and implemented to support sound financial management practices and to ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
"sound management practices are in place to ensure compliance with the faa, tbs and ijc policies and directives related to expenditure initiation, commitment, transaction, certification and payment authorities and activities."
"expenses are processed and reported in a comprehensive, accurate, consistent and timely manner in the financial system."
"the audit team examined a judgmental sample of 159 transactions drawn as follow: 32 contracts to procure goods and services, 24 transactions from acquisition card, 38 travel transactions, 14 hospitality transactions, 18 conference transactions, 30 pay transactions of casual employees and three (3) overtime claims."
"the audit team noted that the cs has adopted many of the tbs policies and directives and where necessary, it has developed its own policies, directives and procedures which are aligned with tbs policies and directives."
the audit noted that roles and responsibilities related to financial management are defined and communicated.
"furthermore, interviews indicated that employees understand their roles and responsibilities in regard to financial, contracting, and human resources management."
"approval, spending and payment authorities the audit team noted that the financial delegation instrument of the cs is appropriate, current, and approved in accordance with the tbs directive on delegation of financial authorities for disbursements."
"furthermore, the audit team found that key authorities such as expenditure initiation, certification and payment authorities are sufficiently restricted to appropriate individuals within cs."
"the review of the 159 financial transactions indicated that overall the approval, certification and payment authorities were properly segregated and exercised."
"the audit team found few exceptions with regards to proper supporting documentation and justifications for deviation from the directive on travel, hospitality, conference and event expenditures."
hospitality hospitality expenses must be formally pre-authorised by the appropriate level of delegation to validate the expense before an event is held and cost reimbursement requests must be accompanied by required documentation.
consistent pre-authorization of hospitality events and enhanced employees- awareness of the need to submit documents required for claims reimbursements (i.e. list of attendance) could be improved.
"the audit examined a sample of 32 contracts to procure goods and services to ensure that: sufficient documentation support the notion that contracts are being awarded in an open, fair and transparent manner; appropriate contracting methods were selected; contracts were reviewed and approved; contract files contained a complete audit trail that included details such as decisions, contract content and administration; and, invoices submitted for payment were in accordance with contract terms, contained sufficient information for certification of payment, and were approved by an individual with the appropriate authority."
"the audit team found sufficient documentation to support that contracts were awarded in an open, fair and transparent manner."
"in addition, the audit team found that documentation was on file to support justification for non-competitive contracting and the appropriate contracting vehicle was used for the selected transactions within its terms and conditions."
"furthermore, invoices submitted for payment were in accordance with contract terms, contained sufficient information for certification of payment, and were approved by an individual with the appropriate authority."
"however, the examination indicated that the cs needs to enhance awareness of details pertaining to contract administration including that contracting files contain all required documentation (i.e. evaluation reports signed by all individual evaluators, evidence of signed consensus decision on bids- assessments, or the equivalent electronically traceable communication)."
the audit team found the bank acquisition card was used in accordance with prevailing policy and guidelines.
the audit found that salaries were paid in accordance with number of hour worked and appropriate rate of pay.
timesheets tested were accurate and submitted with appropriate approvals.
"conclusion the audit found that, overall the cs has put in place policy framework and oversight mechanisms that support sound financial management."
"the audit team has identified some areas of improvement, including ensuring employees are aware of all contracting, travel and hospitality respective policy requirements and ensuring all documentation required is on file to support evidence of appropriate contract administration, travel and hospitality pre-approval and claims processing."
"the audit team also noted that the cs does not proactively disclose contracts over $10,000 as well as travel and hospitality expenses incurred by senior officials."
"the audit did not examine advertised staffing, compensation and appointment processes as well as the payroll administration."
criteria the criteria were developed following the completion of the detailed risk assessment and considered the audit criteria related to the management accountability framework developed by the office of comptroller general of the treasury board secretariat.
"approach and methodology in order to conclude on the above criteria, and based on identified and assessed key risks and internal controls associated with the related business processes, the audit methodology included, but was not limited to the following: identified and reviewed relevant legislations, regulations, policies, directives, and guidelines; conducted walkthroughs of the identified financial management processes and systems, and identify core controls; performed data analysis; reviewed a judgmental risk-based sample of transactions for identified financial management processes and expenditure categories, and assess effectiveness of core controls; and conducted interviews with key stakeholders."
"sampling methodology to select the sample, the following strategy was designed and applied: obtained the population of expenditures for fy 2014-15 and fy 2015-16; reviewed population to determine expense categories through interviews and data analysis (trend variances, value, number of transactions, type of expenses, processes, etc.); stratified the population by expenses categories; and selected a judgmental risk-based sample of transactions for each identified sub-populations (high dollar value, transaction type, misappropriation and error likelihood, reputational risk, etc.)."
observations were noted in the following areas during the audit: roles and responsibilities privileged account management monitoring
"based on a combination of the evidence gathered through the examination of documentation, analysis, interviews and process walk-throughs, each audit criterion was assessed."
"where a significant difference between the audit criterion and the observed practice was found, the risk of the gap was evaluated and used to develop a conclusion and to document recommendations for improvement."

"ssc has not entered into a service agreement with transport canada; however, transport canada will confirm that the service level expectations published on ssc-s service catalogue for application hosting are applicable to legacy environments, including transport canada."
the focus of this audit was to determine whether selected elements of the management accountability framework are in place and functioning as intended to support the internal disclosure process.
"the audit scope period was from april 1, 2014 to march 31, 2016. formal administrative investigations related to security incidents and special investigations conducted by the internal disclosure business line were excluded from the scope of this audit as these investigative functions were assessed as part of the recently completed audits of the pspc special investigations directorate and the corporate security investigative function."
"more information on the audit objective, scope, approach and criteria can be found in the section -about the audit- at the end of the report."
"statement of conformance the audit conforms with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
the findings and conclusion are only applicable to the entity examined and for the scope and time period covered by the audit.
integrity of the internal disclosure process processes and procedures governing the management of internal disclosure investigations are in place and consistent with the psdpa confidence in public institutions is enhanced by establishing effective procedures for the disclosure of wrongdoings and for protecting public servants who disclose wrongdoing.
the psdpa requires senior officers to establish internal procedures to manage disclosures made under the act.
establishing procedures creates a standard against which to compare and supports consistency of investigation practices.
"we expected to find established processes and procedures in place for conducting internal disclosure investigations and that these processes and procedures would be aligned with the requirements of the psdpa, as well as, supporting treasury board of canada secretariat (tbs) and departmental policy instruments."
"the internal disclosure procedures manual (the manual) explains the principles of the psdpa, roles and responsibilities of the senior officer and provides functional direction and guidance to investigators on how investigations should be conducted."
"the manual also outlines each of the procedural steps to be taken by investigators from the intake of a disclosure of wrongdoing, conducting an assessment, and/or an (preliminary) investigation, to reporting and communicating the outcome of the disclosure."
"we conducted a comparative review of the internal disclosure procedures manual against the psdpa, and applicable tbs and departmental policy instruments, such as the departmental policy on public servants disclosure protection (dp 81) and found the manual to be consistent with the requirements defined in these policy instruments."
"the internal disclosure business line has developed and uses a number of tools and templates to further complement the manual, such as generic templates for reports, interview preambles and letters to be sent to disclosers and alleged wrongdoers."
the development of these tools further supports efficiency and rigour in the conduct of internal disclosure investigations.
we noted that absent from the manual was reference to providing the alleged wrongdoer with a copy of the draft or final investigation report.
"the internal disclosure business line has recently developed new guidance which appears to address this gap, formalizing the practice of providing the alleged wrongdoer with a copy of the draft investigation report and an opportunity to comment."
"as of november 2016, when the examination phase of this audit concluded, this guidance had yet to be incorporated into the manual."
we expected established processes and procedures to be consistently applied to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and policies and to support the reliability of the investigation process.
"conducting investigations we reviewed a sample of 10 psdpa files, from a population of 20, covering the audit scope period."
"assessing disclosures for only two of the 10 files in our sample, was there evidence of managerial review and sign-off by the director of the special investigations and internal disclosure directorate or by the senior officer as to whether they concurred with the investigators- assessment that the received disclosure(s) should be investigated under the psdpa, rejected or referred to another internal investigative group, such as staffing oversight or special investigations."
"this procedural step is imperative, as the psdpa is intended to address serious forms of wrongdoing that, because of their scale and nature, have the potential to adversely affect public confidence in the integrity of the federal public sector."
two of these files pertained to an undisclosed conflict of interest in a staffing action and the third was related to abuse of tele-work privileges.
we noted that the preliminary investigation for the conflict of interest files took 116 business days to complete while the tele-work case took 78 business days.
we assessed that a considerable amount of work had been performed for files that were ultimately determined as not meeting the threshold for wrongdoing under the psdpa.
"through this discussion, the importance of developing detailed criteria, as well as, the need for the senior officer to actively engage pertinent departmental stakeholders, such as legal services, was discussed."
"furthermore, files reviewed lacked evidence that the internal disclosure business line regularly engaged legal services to obtain their input in assessing disclosures."
"strengthening the initial assessment process through developing assessment criteria, greater managerial oversight and enhanced engagement with departmental stakeholders, such as legal services, would ensure that the senior officer is effectively utilizing internal disclosure resources on investigations that truly fall within their mandate."
preventing reprisals the psdpa prohibits reprisal against a public servant or former public servant who has made a protected disclosure or has cooperated in an investigation into a disclosure.
"examples of reprisals include disciplinary measures, demotions, terminations and any other measures that adversely affect the employment or working conditions of the public servant."
employees who feel that they are the subject of reprisal may file a complaint with the office of the public sector integrity commissioner or can raise the matter with their supervisor or senior officer.
all formal investigations related to reprisals can only be investigated by the public sector integrity commissioner.
"since 2012, there has only been one case where the internal disclosure business line has had to coordinate with public sector integrity commissioner with respect to the investigation of a reprisal."
"the senior officer, with support from the special investigations and internal disclosure directorate, is responsible for communication and outreach regarding reprisal recourse related to protected disclosers under the psdpa."
the senior officer must provide disclosers and witnesses with information about the reprisal process and try to prevent potential situations of reprisal from occurring.
"these responsibilities include having discussions with disclosers and witnesses about their rights, as well as, engaging management in the branch of concern."
"in our interviews, internal disclosure investigators stated that involved employees were made aware of the reprisal recourse process verbally, at initial contact, and then again by a disposition letter, informing the discloser of the investigation outcome."
"through file testing, we saw evidence that the letter of disposition was sent to all disclosers and that these letters included information about reprisal recourse, as well as contact information for the office of the public sector integrity commissioner."
"due to the confidentiality provisions of the act, we were not in a position to validate the extent to which information about reprisal recourse was shared with employees and their level of comfort in using this mechanism."
"we reviewed the 2016 departmental pulse check survey results - an annual survey sent to all pspc employees to obtain their opinions on issues such as workforce empowerment, harassment/discrimination and employee engagement, and noted that one of the survey questions pertained to employees- willingness to initiate a formal recourse process without fear of reprisal."
the results indicate that 42% responded that they felt free to do so. a further review of the department-s communication and outreach strategy around reprisal recourse will be conducted as part of the horizontal audit of the pspc investigation management accountability framework.
a quality assurance strategy has been developed and is in the process of being implemented the implementation of quality assurance activities provides management with a level of assurance that file administration is aligned with operational procedures.
"we expected the internal disclosure business line to conduct quality assurance activities to help ensure the quality, consistency and efficiency of its internal disclosure investigations."
"in the files we assessed, there was limited evidence that formal quality assurance or control activities were performed."
"[as of november 2016, when the examination phase of this audit concluded, the internal disclosure business line was in the process of implementing a formal quality assurance strategy.]"
"safeguarding the confidentiality of information collected is essential to the psdpa, as public servants who disclose must be confident that their anonymity will be respected."
"we expected internal disclosure information to be secured in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the act, as well as, tbs and departmental information management requirements."
we expected that these requirements would be met for both physical (paper) and electronic information holdings.
"information about internal disclosure files are kept in paper files and in two different information technology applications, gcdocs and site-secure."
the business line also maintains excel worksheets to support the tracking of disclosures and general inquiries they receive about the internal disclosure process.
"all audit observations, and subsequent recommendations, related to site-secure are discussed in the audit of the corporate security investigative function."
performance monitoring and reporting existing performance indicators were not consistently met and some have yet to be developed performance indicators are established to assist management and employees in achieving the department-s commitment to continual improvement and service excellence.
"interviewees stated that, in the past, meeting established service standards had been difficult given a number of internal and external factors which contributed to process delays, such as resourcing constraints within the investigation unit and awaiting information from involved employees and departmental stakeholders."
we assessed an average of 142 business days between the senior officer-s approval of the final investigation report and the discloser being informed of the outcome of the investigation.
"under the psdpa, there is an expectation that that the senior officer will address disclosures in an efficient and timely manner."
"if this expectation is not met, employees may be unwilling to come forward and/or unreasonable delays may create prejudice towards the alleged wrongdoer."
"as of november 2016, when the examination phase of this audit concluded, the internal disclosure business line was in the process of implementing their new performance measurement strategy."
public servants disclosure protection act and treasury board secretariat reporting requirements were not always met reporting is one of the principal means through which departments are able to fulfill their commitment to the public service value of transparency.
"we expected the internal disclosure business line to meet reporting requirements established under the psdpa and by tbs, and that the information being reported would be complete, accurate and timely."
founded investigations under the public servants disclosure protection act the psdpa requires the senior officer to promptly provide public access to information about a founded wrongdoing.
tbs asks that this information be posted on the department-s website within 60 days of the conclusion of the investigation and in situations where this cannot be met; the department must provide a rationale explaining the delay.
"the act also requires the senior officer to, when posting information about founded investigations, describe the wrongdoing and corrective actions taken by the department."
"as part of our file testing, we reviewed one founded investigation and noted that information about the investigation was posted roughly eight months after the conclusion of the investigation report."
"general inquiries tbs also requires departments to report all general inquiries they receive related to the psdpa and defines general inquiries as those regarding procedures established under the act or possible wrongdoing, not to actual disclosures."
"we observed that multiple channels exist for the intake of general inquiries - in person, phone and email."
"as part of our file testing we reviewed five inquiries, from a population of eight, covering the audit scope period."
"of the four files assessed, only two met the definition of an inquiry as defined by tbs."
"for the other two inquiries, individuals were reporting specific allegations of wrongdoing where internal disclosure investigators either completed an initial assessment of the allegation or referred the matter to another internal investigative unit."
sufficient and appropriate audit procedures have been conducted and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the findings and conclusions in this report and to provide an audit level of assurance.
"the findings and conclusions are based on a comparison of the conditions, as they existed at the time, against pre-established audit criteria that were agreed on with management."
we found that the internal disclosure business line had established standard operating procedures which define expectations and procedural steps to be followed in an internal disclosure investigation.
"overall, we found the manual to be clear and detailed."
"although not a legislative or policy requirement, the absence of this procedural step appears to conflict with the concepts of natural justice and procedural fairness which affords individuals the opportunity to know and respond to the evidence that has been gathered against them."
"while the psdpa does not guarantee an individual the right to be heard, it does, in keeping with procedural fairness, require that all reasonable measures be taken to give the alleged wrongdoer a full and ample opportunity to respond to allegations against them."
"procedures were adequately implemented however practices for assessing disclosures could be strengthened the consistent application of internal disclosure investigation procedures supports the integrity of the internal disclosure process, ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and given appropriate recourse to due process."
testing criteria were developed based on procedural steps identified in the manual.
"overall, our review indicated that files were administered in a manner consistent with the manual."
"for example, all reports, (preliminary and investigation) were appropriately prepared and signed-off by the senior officer; alleged wrongdoers were made aware of the investigation; all interviewees were informed of their rights and obligations prior to interviews commencing; and all reports contained evidence that the discloser was informed of the investigation results."
"during the examination phase of this audit, we met with management at the office of the public sector integrity commissioner to discuss how departments could better assess and determine whether an allegation meets the threshold for investigation under the psdpa."
the internal disclosure business line has not developed their own detailed criteria with thresholds such as materiality or position of alleged wrongdoer.
"however, there was evidence that peer reviews were conducted, a practice which supports quality and compliance with the manual."
integrity in the safeguarding of information internal disclosure files are appropriately safeguarded in accordance with treasury board secretariat requirements the psdpa states that the senior officer must establish procedures to ensure the confidentiality of information collected in relation to disclosures of wrongdoing.
"we observed, through on-site observations and information technology application walkthroughs, that paper and electronic files in gcdocs were appropriately safeguarded as per tbs and departmental requirements."
paper files were locked in royal canadian mounted police approved cabinets located in a secure area and information technology application permissions were in place and appropriate for information stored in gcdocs.
"significant risks were identified with the expanded use of site-secure based on our information technology application walk-through of two internal disclosure files, it appears that site-secure currently contains very limited information about internal disclosure investigations."
"however, we have identified several significant operational risks associated with the business line-s possible expanded use of this system, such as privacy breaches, unauthorized use, loss of data and inappropriate disclosure of information."
"we expected that appropriate performance indicators would be developed and in place, and that management would consider performance results to inform decision-making."
"during the audit scope period, the internal disclosure business line had one performance indicator in place, to complete 80% of internal disclosure investigations within 90 days. this calculation was based on the number of days between the senior officer approval of the investigation mandate (plan for proceeding with the investigation) and their sign-off of the final investigation report."
"based on performance information provided to pspc management, the business line has had difficulty meeting this performance indicator, with only 45% of their investigations having been completed within 90 days during the 2014-15 fiscal year."
we found that there were no performance indicators to assess the timeliness between the internal disclosure business line-s receipt of the disclosure and the senior officer-s review and approval of the preliminary investigation of the disclosure (decision to proceed with a formal investigation).
"also, there were no performance indicators in place to measure the timeliness of informing disclosers about the outcome of the investigation."
performance indicators have been revised and are in the process of being implemented we were informed that performance indicators for investigations had recently been revised to better reflect the complexity and risks associated with the disclosure.
"reporting also allows departments to demonstrate compliance with legislation and policy, allowing for appropriate monitoring and oversight."
"as well, the pspc website did not include any details about the corrective measures taken by the department."
"to ensure that all inquiries are being received, responded to, recorded and appropriately reported to tbs, we expected there to be some rigour around the strategy for tracking inquiries."
"in one instance, there was no physical file for the logged inquiry, reducing our file sample to four."
"in the absence of a defined strategy for tracking general inquiries, and supporting quality controls, ensuring the completeness and accuracy of information being reported to tbs is challenging."
"(criteria #7, #15, #16, #17) a review of cihr-s continuity and disaster recovery documentation noted several gaps that could impair or delay the agency-s ability to resume business operations should an incident occur."
the current plan has gaps the primary documentation source for business continuity at cihr is the business continuity plan.
the plan is premised on the cihr offices being inaccessible and focused on providing an alternate location for cihr management to convene and plan for recovery.
"other existing cihr documents relevant to business continuity include a pandemic business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan and it recovery options report."
"roles and responsibilities need to be better defined for ensuring readiness of the program the business continuity plan defines the roles and responsibilities of a crisis management team, and identifies primary and backup personnel to fill these roles."
resource and service allocation need to be clarified.
the current business continuity plan is it focused but continuity of services also requires staff and data in addition to systems and technology.
these additional accountabilities should be considered in the governance structure.
"business continuity plans should reflect current business priorities and be tested for ongoing effectiveness the current plan should be further developed to include key elements to improve its clarity and breadth including: clearly identifying and agreeing on which services are essential to the agency in the case of an incident defining all the elements needed to support essential business activities identified including staff, information and systems within the timelines defined by management."
"linking to other key processes such as emergency preparedness depending on the nature of the event dependencies and commitments to third-parties should also be considered, both those where cihr relies on a service, such as the common payment system, or where we have made a service commitment to other organizations, such as support for the common cv developing the schedule and approach for review and refresh or renewal of the plan detail of monitoring including how often it will be tested, the different types of tests to be carried out, and how the test results will be fed back into the review and refresh process."
"the dso and security team recognize these gaps, and activities are underway to review and revise the business continuity plan."
information technology recovery options are being explored so that management can consider recovery cost information in the prioritization of essential services.
"a) establish, document and communicate the governance structure for the business continuity planning program, including accountabilities, roles and responsibilities for all required elements."
b) conduct a business impact analysis to identify the critical services required to continue operations in the event of an interruption.
"obtain agreement from senior management on the priority and level of operations required for each service, taking into account the cost of continuance and/or recovery of services."
"c) update the business continuity plan to reflect the results of 1a) and 1b), and ensure supporting elements including the disaster recovery plan are identified and aligned."
"d) establish and document a process for regular testing, review and update of the business continuity plan and supporting elements, including how test results will be used to inform future iterations of the plans."
a) to 1d) responsibilities departmental security officer action: agreed the current bcp was approved in october 2011 by emc.
"the dso is currently conducting consultations with management to identify current requirements, review initial assumptions for the bcp-drp, and update the bcp-drp."
"disaster scenarios (bcp) will be developed and table top exercises will be planned, executed and documented to maintain focus and ensure resources are put to best use in case of a crisis."
"expected completion march 31, 2018 mandatory security awareness training is not completed by all new employees and gaps exist in current employees- physical security knowledge."
(criterion #21) cihr has recently updated its onboarding process to include mandatory security awareness training for term and indeterminate employees.
this training is available online from the canada school of public service.
it is up to the supervisor to ensure that new employees attend this training.
"during the period between november 2015 and november 2016, there were fourteen new term and indeterminate employees of whom only two completed the training."
"ongoing security awareness for employees is provided through the security page on the intranet, cihr-wide communications for specific incidents and activities during the annual government of canada security awareness week in february."
"the february 2016 week was primarily focused on information technology security, but physical security was also addressed by materials and activities."
the audit team performed tests to assess security awareness of the employees in certain areas including allowing access to the operations zone and securing of sensitive documents in unattended cubicles and offices.
"a team member unknown to employees and without a visible authorized id card was able to gain admittance to the operations zone on two of cihr-s three floors, and to remain in the area without being challenged."
"an after-hours inspection had similar results, including a document with sensitive employee information."
a) review and update the -protecting and handling information- guideline to include more specific directions on the handling and storage of cihr files.
b) ensure employees have adequate storage cabinets in accordance with the files they handle and the storage requirements; consider implementing a clean-desk policy.
c) ensure that security awareness training and materials include physical security aspects such as access to the premises and the proper protection of documents.
d) ensure new and on strength employees attend the csps security awareness training course as required.
a) responsibility departmental security officer action: agreed security will update the guideline to provide more direction and precision on information handling.
expected completion december 2017 b) responsibility departmental security officer action: partially agreed storage requirements will be addressed and mitigated with training and a clean desk policy will be encouraged.
expected completion: september 2017 c and d) responsibility departmental security officer action: agreed security is currently working on the design of a security awareness program and information management on-line training specific to cihr.
"in our opinion, the csps training module is too generic and basic."
we will coordinate efforts with information management on the content of training and with hr on having this training mandatory for all new and current employees.
"while modifications were made to the staffing of the reception desk on a 24 hour basis with commissionaires, and video surveillance was added, not all the recommendations were implemented."
periodic review ensures that any changes to either the internal or external environment are identified and assessed for impact.
"(criteria#22, #30) the majority of information received and processed by cihr is unclassified or at most protected b."
there is a limited amount of information considered more sensitive that may be classified at the secret level.
this information primarily comprises cabinet confidences whose classification and handling are governed by the privy council office-s policy on the protection of cabinet confidences.
"cabinet confidences are handled by a subset of cihr staff: these documents include memorandums to cabinet, budget submissions, and submissions to treasury board, along with supporting documentation and other briefing materials sent to or received from the minister-s office."
the cihr document protecting and handling information reflects the policy on the protection of cabinet confidences and other treasury board policies.
"it provides guidance to cihr staff on classifying and protecting information received, created, processed and stored at cihr."
this guidance document recommends that submissions to treasury board be classified as secret.
treasury board submissions classified as secret were not stored in approved cabinets.
exposure of this information as a result of improper handling could impact decision-making within the health portfolio and loss of trust in cihr from other government departments.
"conversely, over-classification can result in unnecessary costs and impacts to productivity."
b) ensure all staff who handle paper copies of cabinet confidences are identified and provided with secure storage containers.
a and b) responsibilities departmental security officer action: agreed less than 1% of information is classified at the secret level at cihr.
there are one or two tb submissions per year handled by finance and a secure cabinet is available in the unit.
the government relations unit handles cabinet confidences and correspondence from ministers- offices.
security will review the requirements and provide guidance to staff on the process and procedures related to the handling of secret documents.
"expected completion june 2017 screening requirements for governing council members should be clarified, documented and enforced."
(criteria #24) members of the cihr governing council are appointed by the governor-in-council through a process defined by the privy council office.
part of the privy council office process includes a background check on the candidate comprised of the following elements: police records check by the rcmp; canadian security intelligence service indices check; and a verification with the canada revenue agency for any compliance-related issues.
the results of the background check are confidential to the privy council office and not shared with cihr.
"while the history and origin of this requirement is not recorded, current internal practice asserts that governing council members be screened to the secret level."
a review of the clearance status of governing council members as of november 2016 found that only four of the fourteen active members held this security clearance level.
"through discussion with staff, the primary reason for governing council members not obtaining this clearance level is a delay in completion and return of the necessary forms to cihr form members."
"a) the required clearance level for governing council member should be analyzed, assessed against the current checks that are completed through the governor-in-council process, and the requirements documented."
b) ensure governing council members are cleared to the required level prior to gaining access to sensitive materials.
a and 5b) responsibilities departmental security officer action: agreed cihr security is currently consulting with staff of the governance unit to provide guidance and direction on the process and the importance of having members screened prior to the beginning of their mandate.
security screening forms should become part of the selection process from the beginning.
"(criterion #2, #5, #14 ) the policy on government security requires the departmental security officer to be functionally responsible to the deputy head (the president) or the departmental executive committee (executive management committee)."
"the cihr departmental security officer is also the chief information officer and director general of information technology management and reports to the vice-president, resource planning and management."
formal delegation of authority ensures that accountabilities and responsibilities are clear.
the departmental security plan is developed by the departmental security officer and identifies the security objectives for the agency over a three-year period.
both the previous and current departmental security plans included the short and medium-term actions required to achieve these security objectives.
regular updates to emc and the president on progress of the implementation of the department security plan will provide visibility for security at the senior management level and support the oversight and monitoring of the security program.
"well-defined accountabilities, responsibilities and lines of communication are necessary for an effective response in the event of a security event."
a) formally appoint the departmental security officer with a functional reporting line to the president or the executive management committee.
"b) implement regular, periodic reporting to the executive management committee on progress against the departmental security plan."
a) responsibility departmental security officer action: agreed a letter of appointment as dso by the president of cihr is under development and will be sent to the president for signature.
"cihr has defined procedures for handling security incidents that are specific to the type of incident as follows: the procedures for threatening incidents, harassing and nonsensical telephone calls or correspondence outline the steps for employees to follow if they experience threatening incidents, phone calls or correspondence."
the prevention of violence in the workplace policy which includes details on reporting and responding to these types of incident.
"the intranet page travelling with a cihr mobile device requires employees to report any missing, lost or stolen electronic devices to the it help desk."
"these procedures are focused on initial reporting of incidents, and in some cases, the initial response approach."
a) responsibility departmental security officer action agree cihr security has a suite of processes and procedures in response to several types of incidents and we will develop a more formal process.
"it must be stated that our level of incidents is very low. expected completion: october 2017 during the course of our audit, some minor opportunities for improvement were identified that could strengthen systems of internal control, streamline operations and/or enhance processes related to physical security."
we have documented these observations in a management letter.
appendix audit criteria the audit uses the following definitions to make its assessment of the internal control framework.
"conclusion on audit criteria definition of opinion well controlled well managed, no material weaknesses noted or only minor improvements are needed."
significant improvements required control weaknesses either individually or cumulatively represent the possibility of serious exposure.
overall conclusion the audit has concluded that physical security has moderate issues.
criteria reference to observations
"while cihr does not deliver services that are deemed mission critical to the government of canada, departments and agencies should establish a business continuity program to address other-than-critical services."
a prioritization of business operations is not included as the plan does not envision immediate recovery of operations.
"these documents are inconsistent in how they prioritize services for recovery, and may not represent cihr-s current business priorities."
"the plan documents the responsibilities of the team once an incident has occurred; however the teams- role in the development, approval and ensuring the readiness of the program is not well-defined."
"it was also observed that many files designated protected are left unsecured in cubicles overnight, contrary to the guidance provided in the cihr protecting and handling information document."
risk and impact cihr personnel play an important role both in their own protection and protection of cihr information and assets. lack of detailed guidelines and awareness on physical security and document storage may result in exposure of personnel and information.
the last documented risk assessment of the physical space occupied by cihr occurred in 2009 when a threat and risk assessment (tra) was conducted on the 9th floor reception area and the president-s office at 160 elgin street.
"recommendations were made to address risks identified in three areas - employee safety, facility perimeter security, and classified information / equipment holdings."
the status of the items was not formally tracked to either implement them or have management accept the risk.
tracking the status of recommendations and their associated actions is a key component of ensuring that risks are both understood and either mitigated or accepted by management.
"although cihr has not changed its physical location since its inception, there have been changes in the surrounding environment such as new building tenants and renovations to the building lobby."
"these modifications, along with internal changes, such as new working hours or movement of personnel with the office space, could increase physical security risks."
risk and impact unidentified risks in the physical environment could pose a threat to the security of cihr employees and information assets. lack of tracking can result in identified risks not being addressed or re-work during subsequent risk assessment activities.
a) conduct a threat and risk assessment of physical security risks for the cihr location.
b) document a schedule and identify triggering events for review and re-evaluation of risks related to physical security.
c) track the status of identified risks and action items to closure.
ensure management formally accepts residual risks.
"a and b) responsibilities departmental security officer action: agreed following the last assessment, risks identified were mitigated and our threat and risk levels remain low. security will review and assess the physical risk landscape to identify new or evolving risks to cihr personnel and assets."
"expected completion september 30, 2017 c) responsibility departmental security officer action: agreed cihr security will track the status of identified risks and action items (3a and 3b) to closure and will ensure through briefings and written notifications that management formally accepts residual risks."
"expected completion: march 31, 2018 personnel who handle sensitive documents are not always provided with approved storage containers and would benefit from additional guidance on classification and handling."
"while key staff members who receive and coordinate information with the minister-s office have been provided with the appropriate cabinets for storing sensitive information, not all personnel that handle these documents are so equipped."
"however, the policy on the protection of cabinet confidences stipulates that submissions to treasury board and supporting materials be classified according to their content with a minimum classification of protected b. interviews with staff that handle these documents found that a mix of classifications is used and additional guidance would be useful."
"although not documented, there is a general understanding within cihr that treasury board submissions do not have the same level of sensitivity once they have been approved by the board and may be handled and stored differently than before they are approved."
"however, the policy on the protection of cabinet confidences states -cabinet confidences that have been in existence for more than 20 years may be declassified or downgraded by the originating organization in accordance with departmental criteria for the declassification or downgrading of sensitive information.- risk and impact protection of cabinet confidences is a convention that -protects the collective decision-making process and solidarity of ministers, enabling them to support government decisions despite any differing views-."
"a) review the guidance for classification of treasury board submissions, update as appropriate and ensure staff are aware of the full life-cycle requirements for these documents."
risk and impact security screening is one of the elements required to mitigate potential improper use and disclosure of sensitive information.
"without verifying the background of committee members who have a need to review sensitive documents, there is a risk of information misuse or exposure."
"while the risk may be somewhat mitigated by the background checks conducted by the privy council office, it is cihr that has the responsibility to ensure those provided with sensitive information have met the necessary clearance requirements."
assign ownership to the appropriate group for ensuring members complete and return required documentation.
such a relationship facilitates the departmental security officer-s ability to carry out their duty to recommend appropriate remedial action to the deputy head or senior management committee (as appropriate) in order to address any identified deficiencies in the agency security program.
the departmental security officer does have regular status updates with the president providing an opportunity to discuss security matters directly with the deputy head; however this reporting relationship is not formalized.
monitoring and oversight of progress against the plan enables senior management to assess progress towards the security objectives and the mitigation of identified risks.
"risk and impact without formal delegation of authority and establishment of clear reporting lines between the departmental security officer and senior management, security matters may not receive the necessary oversight or be taken into consideration in business decisions."
"expected completion: march 31, 2017 b) responsibility departmental security officer agreed regular updates to emc and the president on progress of the implementation of the department security plan and other relevant updates will be provided once a year and when new risks are identified expected completion: september 2017 there is no overall process for security incidents to ensure proper reporting and capture of data for trend analysis."
"(criteria #18) the operational security standard on physical security requires departments to establish measures to respond to physical security incidents that ensure they are reported to appropriate security officials, and that immediate and long-term corrective action is taken in a timely fashion."
"while the immediate response to an incident is of paramount importance to ensure the protection of employees and assets, incident analysis, lessons learned and corrective actions are also part of effective ongoing security and risk management."
a documented framework or process that allows for security incidents to be triaged and the appropriate course of action taken through to final closure would ensure all stakeholders are involved as required.
a standardized approach to the collection of information about security incidents also allows for analysis of trends to identify risk areas as well as possible gaps in security awareness and training of employees.
"risk and impact without a defined process for the full lifecycle of managing a security incident, internal and external reporting may not be completed as required."
lack of history and analysis on all security incidents may result in risks not being assessed or missed opportunities to improve security awareness.
a) establish and document a process to classify security incidents to ensure that: reporting to internal and external stakeholders is performed as required; analysis is performed and corrective actions taken; and incidents are tracked to allow for trend analysis and input to risk assessments.
this included established processes for oversight bodies to review the results of monitoring activities and perform follow-ups on recommendations.
"ps has implemented a formal governance structure to ensure sound financial management, including icfr."
"the key oversight bodies include the departmental management committee (dmc), which the deputy minister (dm) chairs, and the departmental audit committee (dac), chaired by an external member."
dmc-s terms of reference outline their oversight responsibilities for the department-s internal controls related to the annual financial cycle.
the dac-s charter includes the responsibility to review the annual statement of management responsibility including internal controls over financial reporting and to provide advice to the deputy minister on the effectiveness of icfr.
dmc has received presentations on all icfr monitoring results with related actions documented in records of decision.
"further, the dac received periodic updates on all remediation activities stemming from ongoing monitoring testing/results."
"the dac reviews the annex in the statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting, which outlines the details of the progress made during the year, the results and the planned activities for the upcoming year."
ps has developed flowcharts and related narratives to document and highlight key controls in order to support the accuracy of financial statements.
"business owners validate and update, as necessary, the flowcharts and narratives."
icu then establishes a test plan and examines a sample of transactions.
"in the case of a control weakness, recommendations are provided to the process owners who develop action plans with target dates."
the icu tracks implementation and follows-up to ensure action plans are completed.
"for all processes tested in 2014-15 and 2015-16, icu communicated the results for which action plans were established."
"ps has an established governance structure, an internal control framework and a formal monitoring program to identify and monitor the state of icfr."
"as part of the audit, we expected to find a monitoring program that includes an established process to test and report on the automated application controls related to sap."
"considering that the rcmp hosts the department-s sap, we expected that an approach would be in place to rely on the host-s automated application controls."
"as noted in the annex of the departmental financial statements, a memorandum of understanding (mou) exists between ps and the rcmp outlining roles and responsibilities in support of the department-s use of sap."
"specifically, the rcmp is obligated to provide help desk functions and -train the trainer- sessions for any upgrades or releases."
"according to the interviews conducted, ps has direct and timely access to the rcmp support team."
"furthermore, ps has full control of sap user-access and vendor management (see graph 2)."
"to provide ps users with access and support to sap, the department-s financial systems group has developed training and service standards, which are currently under revision."
"in reviewing the sampled processes and associated monitoring activities, we noted that no documentation exists for sap application controls."
"according to the mou covering the fiscal year 2016-17, the rcmp is to submit an annual attestation letter to ps providing reasonable assurance of the existence and effective functioning of its system controls."
"furthermore, they have provided their testing plan against which they will start monitoring the key automated controls."
the results will be the focus of the attestation letter for 2016-17.
"ps has established an approach for ongoing monitoring that includes consultations with process owners to review and update documentation, and to ensure the design and operating effectiveness of key controls."
"the results of these tests are formally reported to management, which include recommendations, as applicable."
"the results found in the annex to the statement of management responsibility for march 31, 2015 accurately reflected the monitoring activities."
ps reported that the elcs supporting financial management were re-assessed and monitoring activities were completed with no remedial actions required.
the schedule of cyclical monitoring outlines that elcs are examined on an ongoing basis.
"in 2013, coso released a more updated version of its framework by introducing 17 principles as fundamental concepts associated with the components of internal control (as compared to the -key concepts- outlined in the previous framework)."
"while a transition to the 2013 framework would not significantly affect the design of elcs, mapping them to the 2013 framework may reduce the number of key controls to assess in order to ensure the most efficient approach to monitoring."
"recommendation the assistant deputy minister, cmb, should: review and align elcs that apply to icfr implement an ongoing monitoring approach and cycle for the mapped elcs to be included in ps- overall icfr monitoring program."
overall conclusion an effective governance structure is in place to monitor the state of icfr.
"in addition, ps has established a framework for documenting and periodically updating key icfr."
two minor improvements related to the monitoring of the key elcs and automated controls were identified that would strengthen the department-s system of icfr.
management response and action plan management accepts the recommendations of internal audit.
the recommendations recognize that all departmental managers share the accountability for icfr and the implementation of pic.
cmb will identify and document the sap application controls supported by the rcmp and relied upon.
"july 31, 2017 cmb will contact the rcmp to identify the sap automated application controls that they are monitoring."
"august 30, 2017 recommendation: the assistant deputy minister, cmb, should: review and align elcs that apply to icfr implement an ongoing monitoring approach and cycle for the mapped elcs to be included in ps- overall icfr monitoring program."
cmb will review and identify elc-s that apply to icfr.
"september 30, 2017 cmb will implement a formal ongoing monitoring approach and cycle for key elcs, to be included in ps- overall icfr monitoring program."
30-Jun-17
"the departmental framework and processes have been developed in support of internal controls over financial reporting an established framework, documented financial processes, the identification of all key controls, and the ongoing assessment of their effectiveness and appropriateness in support of internal controls over financial reporting are required to meet the policy expected results."
ps has established a risk-based internal control framework that includes internal control financial management (icfm) and internal control over financial reporting (icfr).
the framework outlines the main principles for identifying risk and criteria for conducting a risk assessment.
it also provides guidelines on monitoring based on funding thresholds.
icu has established a risk-based approach for ongoing monitoring of icfr.
#NAME?
"the relevant automated application controls supported by the rcmp have neither been documented nor confirmed the systems, applications & products (sap) is the department-s enterprise financial system."
"it is the source system for key financial processes, including procurement to payment and payroll (based on information provided from central agencies) and is financially relevant for icfr."
our analysis confirmed that ps relies on the rcmp to test sap controls as part of its monitoring program.
the mou does not specifically identify which controls the rcmp will address.
"to date, ps has not received an attestation letter or equivalent document providing the state of controls related to sap, as the rcmp has not completed the relevant control testing to date."
"however, we were advised that the rcmp will prepare the attestation letter at the end of fiscal year 2016-17. without identifying the application controls to mitigate existing risks and confirming monitoring coverage, ps does not have the assurance that the required controls are being tested and monitored to support icfr."
"however, ps was informed that rcmp is assessing the design and operating effectiveness of information technology general controls."
"recommendation the assistant deputy minister, corporate management branch (cmb) should: identify and document the sap application controls upon which ps relies. highlight the sap controls that are supported by the rcmp. communicate with the rcmp to identify the specific sap automated application controls that they are monitoring. evaluate whether the key controls identified are sufficient to address the risks identified by the department. establish additional controls where rcmp coverage is deemed insufficient."
"entity-level controls in support of financial reporting require testing and monitoring on an appropriate cycle entity-level controls (elcs) are departmental controls that include tone at the top, ethics, risk management, communications, and human resources."
"the coso framework is used to support organizations in establishing and maintaining systems of internal controls that -can enhance the likelihood of achieving the entity-s objectives and adapt to changes in the business and operating environments.- as indicated in the risk-based internal control framework the identification and monitoring of internal control over financial management, which includes elcs, is shared between the chief financial officer and the branch assistant deputy ministers (adms)."
this is completed over a three-year rotation based on risk.
the icu more frequently tests the financial processes or controls deemed higher risk.
"the audit confirmed that the financial processes targeted to be subject to ongoing monitoring in 2014-15 and 2015-16, as outlined in the annex to the statement of management responsibility, were completed and reported on during the fiscal years to which they were committed."
"documentation provided during the audit confirmed that icu identified, documented and tested the elcs relevant to financial management as part of the department-s original implementation of pic in 2013."
icu has not formally assessed elcs since 2013.
"furthermore, the monitoring schedule does not provide the scope of the testing that is completed in line with the organizational accountability structure presented in the risk-based internal control framework."
we also noted that the existing elc documentation aligns with an older version of the coso framework.
"the department has also implemented a risk-based monitoring program that is being consistently applied and reported on, including a process to agree upon, monitor and report periodically on remediation actions resulting from ongoing monitoring activities."
"management action plan target completion date recommendation: the assistant deputy minister, corporate management branch (cmb) should: identify and document the sap controls upon which ps relies. highlight the sap controls that are supported by the rcmp. communicate with the rcmp to identify the specific sap automated application controls that they are monitoring. evaluate whether the key controls identified are sufficient to address the risks identified by the department. establish additional controls where rcmp coverage is deemed insufficient."
"july 31, 2017 cmb will evaluate the attestation and testing documentation received from the rcmp to determine that the key controls monitored mitigate departmental risk identified and that they are functioning effectively."
"august 30, 2017 if necessary, compensating controls will be established if rcmp coverage is not deemed sufficient."
the department has planned for the continued availability of its critical services the following section summarizes key observations on the state of continuity planning within the department.
continuity program governance the department has established a bcp program with supporting directives and tools.
"the emergency management and business continuity (embc) division, within isb, is responsible for the national coordination of the departmental bcp program (along with a number of other emergency management responsibilities)."
the embc division has been found to provide the required guidance and direction to branches and regions with respect to continuity planning.
"key stakeholders up to and including the branch assistant deputy ministers (adms) are involved in the development, approval, implementation and testing of plans."
"as a result, timely and coherent assessments of services are challenging."
"the embc division extracted a list of 22 programs and services that were deemed critical, 12 of which require recovery within a 0-72 hours range."
"supporting these services, a number of activities were identified and provide a foundation for a change to a -service-based- approach."
critical services that require recovery within a 0-72 hours range have not been prioritized amongst themselves.
"in the event of a horizontal disaster affecting multiple services, prioritization of services would benefit from being defined and agreed upon prior to the disruption."
continuity plans all 22 critical services have documented continuity plans and their associated recovery strategies.
the integration of continuity plans between branches and regions into -service-based- horizontal plans is not consistently performed but is improving.
"the department relies on other government entities, such as shared services canada (ssc) and public services and procurement canada (pspc), for achieving the delivery of some of its critical services."
arrangements are rarely documented or formalized to integrate the department-s plans and the plans of these government entities.
"even so, dialogue and collaboration is happening."
"for example, ssc and pspc were in attendance at the november 2016 table-top exercise."
"adopting a horizontal approach to continuity planning could facilitate coordination between the department and other government entities; this is not only desirable in cases where the department relies on external partners but also in cases where other government departments rely on employment and social development canada (esdc) for the delivery of their critical services (e.g. immigration, refugees and citizenship canada for the passport program)."
maintenance of readiness table-top exercises are conducted by some branches and at the departmental level to validate the content of plans.
one of the key lessons learned from the department-wide november 2016 table-top exercise was that -service-based- horizontal plans where multiple branches coordinate their efforts are essential to ensure the continued availability of critical services.
the department-wide november 2016 table-top exercise was also valuable in identifying challenges and provided a platform for discussing continuity planning in a horizontal manner.
we consider the regular conduct of continuity exercises a best practice to be continued.
"furthermore, external service providers and partners have been involved in the testing of business continuity plans."
this is also a best practice that ought to be continued.
lessons learned from exercises as well as real-life incidents are considered when reviewing and updating continuity plans.
overall observations better information management tools are required to allow for effective and efficient management of the bcp program.
bcp coordinators within branches and regions don-t always have the time or training to be effective continuity planning agents.
"the evolution towards continuity -subject matter experts- should be explored; the innovation, information and technology branch is moving in that direction."
the implementation of a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning is required treasury board-s operational security standard on bcp program promotes a -service-based- view of the organisation.
"consequently, impact assessments and continuity plans ought to target services, rather than operational units, directorates, branches or even business lines."
the department-s approach to continuity planning is outlined in the operational directive on business continuity management.
"this directive requires -managers at all levels across the portfolio, branches and regions- to complete business impact analyses and directors to complete continuity plans."
this approach creates an environment where the following processes supporting continuity planning become challenging to sustain.
"for example, call or processing centre managers are required by the directive to individually complete an impact analysis for the services their centre provides."
this has led some regions to group offices together that offer similar services in order to avoid duplication.
"the current approach results in individuals across the department to assess similar services, often in isolation."
"to alleviate this issue, the embc division has developed a business impact assessment companion guide to assist managers in completing their analysis in a comparable and coherent manner."
the number of business impact analyses completed (963) throughout the department makes the review and challenge function by the embc division difficult to sustain.
"this was intended to allow the embc division to review, challenge and compile a list of prioritized critical services with limited effort."
"for example, data entry was abandoned by some managers following technical issues; data integrity could not be enforced to ensure meaningful reporting; and half of expected reports could not be generated."
"as a result, a manual review and challenge had to be performed on thousands of business functions that were identified as -critical-."
continuity plans continuity plans across the department have been developed by directors and approved by directors general and adms.
"the resulting collection of division-level plans suffers issues similar to the issues associated with the impact analysis process such as duplication of effort to develop plans for similar services, time-consuming review and maintenance of the hundreds of resulting plans."
"when recovery strategies are fully implemented, this is not an issue."
plans developed in isolation cannot be effectively coordinated across the department.
"to ensure their continued delivery, all critical services require multiple interdependent branches to coordinate their recovery strategies."
"realizing that a more horizontal approach was necessary, the embc division worked with key branches to develop service-based -horizontal- plans."
"these plans for employment insurance (ei), the canada pension plan (cpp) and old age security (oas) were tested in the november 2016 department-wide table-top exercise."
other service-based -horizontal- continuity plans are expected to be completed in the coming years.
"while silos are still a challenge, and current -horizontal- plans are owned by distinct branches with references to other plans (e.g. ei plan referring to the citizen service plan), the department is moving in the right direction with the development of comprehensive horizontal plans."
collaborative efforts between national headquarter branches and regional delivery networks need to be supported to have a fully integrated approach to business continuity planning.
recommendation the adm of isb should adopt a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning that seeks to minimize effort duplication.
"this approach should be sustainable, coherent and consistent across the department."
management response isb agrees with the recommendation.
the department already adopted a horizontal service-based approach to business continuity planning which has been used for its most critical benefit services.
the business continuity management directive will be reviewed and revised to: align bcp activities with a horizontal service-based approach; streamline non-critical business line business continuity plans and minimize the need for manager level business impact assessments; and reduce duplication of effort for individual plans with similar business functions through horizontal service-based planning applying standardized business functions.
"isb, working with the innovation, information and technology branch will continue the process to acquire a suitable tool to support data management."
"the intent is that this application will address business continuity, disaster recovery, building emergency planning and emergency response."
a strong emphasis is being placed on application efficiency and the ability to interact with existing data sources.
"as of january 2017, these planned actions have already commenced with key activities scheduled to be completed over the next three fiscal years with full completion by march 2020. changes affecting the delivery of critical services require a stronger oversight of recovery options development, assessment, selection and implementation in an increasingly automated environment, complete and well-articulated assessments of recovery strategies are paramount if they are to be adequately funded and effectively supported by external service providers."
"for example, following years of automation efforts, ei has become highly dependent on it for both its intake and processing activities."
"in 2009, internal audit completed an assessment of ei-s continuity plan and concluded that, even at this early stage in the automation, -some functions essential to providing the service could not be restored within an acceptable timeframe at a minimum acceptable level should a disruptive event occur-."
"more than ever now, the capacity of the ei program to operate without its it infrastructure is limited considering the declining capacity to manually process claims."
"on the other hand, as observed by internal audit during the november 2016 table-top exercise, processes related to pension programs have a certain resiliency to it disruptions because they are still mostly paper-based."
the department has prioritized the implementation of digital tools and automated processes so canadians can access departmental services using digital self-service.
"to achieve this, a number of initiatives supported by investment projects are underway (e.g. cpp and oas service improvement strategies, ei automation agenda, benefits delivery modernization)."
"these initiatives will require the development, assessment, selection and implementation of updated recovery strategies."
"when pressed for time, technical testing of the recovery strategies is often limited and provides little assurance as to the viability of the it components of continuity plans."
ssc is now responsible for critical components of the it infrastructure supporting the delivery of departmental services.
"as a result, ensuring that roles and responsibilities are well defined for ssc and esdc is foundational to continuity."
"to this effect, the department has been working since 2015 on an it service continuity management framework that defines how ssc and esdc share the responsibility for service resumption."
"recommendation the adm of isb, in collaboration with the senior adm of the transformation and integrated service management branch, should develop processes to oversee the development, assessment, selection, funding and implementation of updated recovery options for critical services impacted by the implementation of digital tools and automated processes."
management response management agrees with the recommendation.
"isb, in collaboration with transformation and integrated service management branch, will develop a process to ensure that bcp is incorporated into all transformation initiatives and projects."
these measures will ensure that transformational projects adopt a bcp by design approach and measures for recovery strategies and associated costs are put in place during the project and for the future state.
this activity will build upon the development of a refined list of critical business functions grouped by service.
actions are expected to be completed by october 2017. conclusion the audit concluded that the department has planned for the continued availability of its critical services.
"furthermore, in an increasingly automated environment, recovery strategies need adequate management support, funding and coordination with internal and external supporting services to ensure the continued availability of the department-s critical services."
the conclusions are applicable only for the audit of business continuity planning.
the evidence was gathered in accordance with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada and the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing.
"however, integration within the strategic planning framework is challenging given the department-s decentralized siloed approach to continuity planning."
"critical services identification and prioritization all departmental services have been assessed as to criticality, however current processes have not been formalized and are inconsistent."
"however, most selected recovery strategies rarely detail their benefits, risks, feasibility and costs."
internal audit observed an increase in continuity planning related activities in the weeks preceding the exercise (e.g. increased branch working group meetings).
the leadership of the embc division alone is not sufficient to ensure adequate governance.
the continuity planning community could benefit from additional training to promote consistent understanding of terminology and practices.
business impact analyses for identification and prioritization of critical services the current approach to completing business impact analyses leads to the following issues: internal audit observed duplication of work between managers responsible for similar services.
however there is still duplication across regions resulting in impact analyses covering the same services.
internal audit observed some cases of over-classification where some non-critical services were assessed as critical.
"however, the data repository used to collect and analyse the information had system limitations and performance problems that compromised data entry, data integrity and reporting capability."
"furthermore, this approach which is aligned with the organisational structure of the department reinforces existing silos and does not foster a -service-based- view of the organization: current tactical division-level continuity plans are rarely integrated into branches- operational or strategic plans."
"however, when the recovery strategies are not fully funded or implemented, integration in a branch strategic or operational plan allows for better oversight of these strategies."
"isb, in collaboration with branches and regions, will adopt a prioritization approach working from highest risk to lower risk to ensure that detailed planning, recovery strategies and resources are put in place for all critical services."
"these new strategies have to take into account the increasing reliance on technology to deliver critical services and address the following issues noted by the audit: although recovery strategies are considered and proposed as part of investment or treasury board submission, they often receive limited funding leading to gaps in the recovery capability of the critical services they support."
"however, to be effective and efficient, a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning needs to be implemented."
"statement of assurance in our professional judgement, sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were performed and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the conclusions reached and contained in this report."
the conclusions were based on observations and analyses at the time of our audit.
"appendix a: audit criteria assessment audit criteria rating bcp governance bcp is integrated into the department-s strategic and operational plans bcp involves key stakeholders that can provide adequate decision making and oversight conducting business impact assessments all departmental services have been assessed to determine which ones are likely to cause a high degree of injury to canadians or the working of government, if disrupted critical services have been prioritized based on maximum allowable downtime and the minimum service level required before a high degree of injury will result development of business continuity plans and arrangements for each critical service, continuity or recovery options have been analysed to recommend the most appropriate strategy for each critical service, comprehensive continuity plans based on the selected strategy are, as per applicable standards and policies: developed approved funded arrangements with internal and external service providers are in place so plans can be put into effect, and where the department shares in the delivery of a critical service, the plans are coordinated maintenance of bcp program readiness continuity plans are reviewed and updated as needed to account for changes to the services the department must deliver continuity plans are regularly tested and updated based on the results of those tests table-top exercises it technical aspects best practice sufficiently controlled, low risk exposure controlled, but should be strengthened, medium risk exposure missing key controls, high risk exposure"
"area responsible expected completion date for the remaining work to be completed, the chief information officer should clarify the individual responsibilities to ensure both accountability for attaining specific business outcomes, and that overall objectives of all projects are achieved as intended."
the project management office will update the roles and responsibilities for the executive sponsor in the sap merge project charter to include the following additional statement: the executive sponsor in his capacity as the system owner of sap is accountable for attaining the business outcomes as defined in section 5.2 of this project charter and ensures that overall project objectives are achieved as intended.
"in addition, names of individuals assigned to specific roles in the roles and responsibilities section of the sap merge project charter will be updated to reflect current membership."
"chief information officer april 15, 2017 the chief information officer should continue implementing the full communications plan for the sap merge prior to the -go live- date to ensure that all system end users are fully aware of changes and any potential impacts on their daily operations prior to the changes going into effect."
the project services team worked with project stakeholders and the communications branch to develop and publish a broadcast message providing information on sap merge project timelines and changes and impacts to users.
"the first broadcast was published on march 16, 2017 and a second one will be published in april 2017."
the project services team worked with project stakeholders and the communications branch to develop a broadcast message providing information on the service interruption window.
"the broadcast was published the week of april 17, 2017."
"the intranet page published on march 16, 2017 will be updated with additional content as required."
project stakeholders will continue to send directed emails of each broadcast message to their network of users to ensure they are aware of the changes and brief the user communities accordingly in meetings.
"chief information officer ongoing, completion by end of may 2017 for the remaining work to be completed, the chief information officer should define levels for the approval of scope changes."
"as defined in the sap merge project charter, the director level steering committee is responsible for performing change management functions including approval of any scope changes."
"to date there have been no changes to the original scope and at this stage, deviations from scope as defined in the sap merge project charter are unlikely."
"if a scope change is necessary to meet the sap merge go-live date, the director level steering committee will be informed and their recommendations will be brought to the dg steering committee for their approval."
"chief information officer ongoing, completion by end of may 2017 for the remaining work to be completed, the chief information officer should ensure that contingency plans for sap merge are fully developed, approved and communicated."

the sap merge deployment plan will be communicated to the project steering committees for endorsement.
"chief information officer ongoing, completion by end of quarter 1, 2017-2018"
"improvements are needed to increase senior management-s awareness and knowledge of the status of icfr through enhanced reporting and communication. additionally, improvements are needed to proactively involve business process owners through effective communication to ensure they understand and fulfil their roles and responsibilities in the icfr process."
"with the completion of the last operating effectiveness testing and the commencement of the ongoing monitoring process in fiscal year 2015-16, the management action plans addressing recommendations from the oag-s 2013 audit are completed."
"the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
"statement of conformance in my professional judgment as the chief audit executive, this audit was conducted in conformance with the institute of internal auditors' international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing and with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
"the plan was recommended by the departmental audit committee on september 27, 2016 and subsequently approved by the deputy minister of foreign affairs on october 17th, 2016."
"in 2009, treasury board introduced the policy on internal control (pic)."
the pic requires that the dms and chief financial officers (cfo) sign a statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting.
this document accompanies the departmental financial statements and acknowledges the responsibility of management for ensuring the maintenance of an effective system of icfr.
"additionally, icfr provides information that aids in the preparation of internal and external financial reports and statements in accordance with policies, directives and standards."
"finally, icfr helps to provide assurance that revenues received and expenditures made are in accordance with delegated authorities, and unauthorized or erroneous transactions that could have a material effect on financial information and financial statements are prevented or detected in a timely manner."
"icfr at global affairs canada the department of foreign affairs, trade and development-s (now global affairs canada) framework for internal control over financial reporting management (the framework) came into effect january 1, 2014."
this framework establishes the approach and defines roles and responsibilities regarding the system of icfr at global affairs canada.
the deputy minister of foreign affairs assumes overall responsibility and leadership for the measures taken to maintain an effective system of icfr.
senior departmental managers are responsible for ensuring that a system of icfr within their branch is well managed and effective.
heads of mission are responsible for ensuring that a system of icfr within their respective mission is well managed and effective.
managers at all level of the department are also accountable for the effective operations of controls in their respective business processes.
"lastly, the internal control team, within the corporate accounting, financial policies, and controls division (smo), is responsible for the development and maintenance of the framework and for the annual assessment of icfr."
the icfr process the icfr process is a documented series of activities that demonstrate that an effective system of internal controls is in place and operational.
"it ensures that due diligence required of the dms and cfo to sign the statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting, which accompanies the departmental financial statements (the annex), has been completed."
"for a visual representation of the icfr process, refer to appendix a."
it involved allocating the financial statement values between the department-s business processes and determining the most material business processes within the department.
information technology general controls (itgcs) - relative to the department-s general it infrastructure and systems.
"business process controls - both manual and automated, are embedded in business processes applicable to financial transactions."
these controls may change over time due to changes in the department-s business processes.
"control testing encompasses three components: design effectiveness testing, operating effectiveness testing, and ongoing monitoring."
design effectiveness testing the first step of control testing is design effectiveness testing.
"this testing determines whether the organization-s controls are designed to satisfy the organization-s control objectives, including preventing or detecting errors or fraud that could result in material misstatements in the financial statements."
"prior to fiscal year 2015-16, all material processes at the department were assessed for design effectiveness."
"operating effectiveness testing once the design effectiveness testing has been satisfied, each process undergoes operating effectiveness testing."
operating effectiveness testing assesses if the key controls (identified during design effectiveness testing) are operating as intended.
any significant control deficiencies identified will require a management action plan to address the control weaknesses.
all operating effectiveness testing must be completed before commencing ongoing monitoring of the processes.
"prior to fiscal year 2015-16, all material processes at the department were assessed for operating effectiveness, with the exception of the transfer payments for development programs process, which was completed in fiscal year 2015-16."
"ongoing monitoring once the design and operating effectiveness testing have both been completed on the business processes, the processes can enter into the ongoing monitoring phase of the control testing."
"reporting following the testing of controls, a report is produced to conclude on the effectiveness of the system of controls of the business process."
"if control weaknesses were identified during testing, they are reported to the process owners with recommended actions to mitigate them."
"audit results were derived from the examination of: related policies and documentation; methodologies and tools used by the internal control team for selecting and assessing key business processes and controls; and, interviews with key individuals responsible for implementing icfr."
"governance of the icfr process the governance of the icfr process is the combination of processes and structures implemented in order to direct, manage and monitor the activities of the department to adhere to the pic."
"at global affairs canada, these responsibilities are held by senior management (including the dms, adms, and cfo) and operationally by the internal control team."
"to evaluate governance of the icfr process at the department, the audit team reviewed departmental and government of canada documentation, committee records of decision, and communications with key stakeholders."
"icfr policy framework the internal control team developed the framework for the management of internal control over financial reporting (the framework), which is an overall guidance document that was approved by the deputy minister of foreign affairs on february 12, 2014."
"the framework defines icfr-related roles and responsibilities for key individuals (including executives, senior managers, and employees)."
"it also describes in greater detail the process to be followed to prepare the financial statements- annex, as well as the principles, control structure, assessment and the corrective actions process that should be followed."
"on the intranet page entitled -internal control-, the internal control team provides an overview of the pic, benefits to the department, challenges the department faces, the control processes to be covered, and the assessment process to be followed."
"relevant documents, including the framework, the pic, and the department-s financial statements, are also found on this intranet page."
"the dac mandate includes a requirement to provide advice on -departmental internal control arrangements, and be informed on all matters of significance-."
a review of the dac records of discussion for fiscal year 2015-16 and 2016-17 shows that the departmental financial statements with the associated annex to the statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting (the annex) were presented to the dac in august of 2015 and 2016. no other discussions on icfr were noted in the dac records of decision.
"in addition to the reporting requirements to the dac, the framework states that the cfo is to present an update on icfr twice a year to the executive board."
the audit team also reviewed the terms of reference and records of decision in fiscal year 2015-16 for all other departmental executive committees.
reporting on the effectiveness of icfr to oversight bodies communicating the state of effectiveness of icfr is a key aspect of the icfr process.
the departmental senior executives and oversight bodies require timely reporting to stay informed of the icfr monitoring and compliance activities.
"though the 2015-2016 testing for the transfer payments process concluded that the controls were not operating effectively, these results were not clearly communicated to dac."
not clearly reporting significant findings to members of the executive board may limit their ability to properly conduct their roles and responsibilities pertaining to icfr.
assessment methodology and testing results were also reviewed to ensure that there was evidence to support the system of controls that are operating effectively.
"icfr process at global affairs canada in fiscal year 2015-16, the internal control team completed operating effectiveness testing on the transfer payments for development programs process."
"in addition, they implemented the department-s ongoing monitoring program."
"due to amalgamation-related priorities, this process was the last to require operating effectiveness testing."
"for the 13 manual controls tested, the audit concluded that detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed in a satisfactory manner by the internal control team for the operating effectiveness testing of transfer payments for development programs."
a special review was completed by contracted resources on the 7 key automated controls.
"the objective of this review was to support the department-s compliance with the pic, by assessing the design and operating effectiveness of the automated controls."
the detailed testing results were presented in a final report to the internal control team.
"for fiscal year 2015-16, the ongoing monitoring plan included the following key business processes: revenues, investments, and advances to international financial institutions, loans to developing countries and international financial institutions, and entity level controls."
these documents were used to update the key controls for each business process identified in the design and operating effectiveness testing.
the internal control team visits at least one mission per fiscal year to conduct ongoing monitoring of the controls.
"to select the mission(s), a mission financial assessment was conducted by the internal control team on four key business processes found in each mission: locally engaged staff payroll, capital assets, revenues, and payments."
the internal control team uses this list to select the mission(s) they will visit each fiscal year.
"key controls identification and testing due to the complex and differing operating environments of canada-s missions abroad, the internal control team identified 43 common key controls across different processes that each mission is expected to have in place."
key controls identification and testing testing activities were prepared and performed for the four kcosr activities identified.
better documentation of the process selection for kcosr would help provide clarity and assist decision making with respect to the ongoing monitoring program.
communication of icfr with business process owners communication with stakeholders is a key aspect of the icfr process.
"effective communication ensures that process owners understand their roles and responsibilities, which in turn supports an effective and well managed icfr system within their business unit."
"from this work, it was concluded that improvement is required in communicating icfr roles and responsibilities to process owners, and communicating testing results to senior management and oversight bodies."
"icfr roles and responsibilities communication senior management has overall responsibility for the management of the department, including the design, implementation, and monitoring of icfr and internal controls more broadly."
managers at all levels of the department are accountable for the effective operation of controls in their areas.
each business process is subject to controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the process operates effectively and that records accurately reflect individual transactions.
"with a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities for internal controls related to their processes, business process owners can play a proactive role to ensure the effectiveness of the internal controls."
in most cases the communication relates directly to the process assessments that the team performs.
"testing result communication once the testing of a business process is complete, the internal control team prepares a summary report with key observations and recommendations for the business process that was tested."
the report is shared with the director-level process owner who is provided with an opportunity to respond to the findings.
"feedback received from the process owner is incorporated into the final report which is then sent by the director general of smd to the director general(s) of the process, along with a management action plan for completion."
"the audit team reviewed all icfr assessment reports prepared for operating effectiveness and ongoing monitoring testing, including reports on the testing of key automated controls."
"all reports, which included management action plans, were shared with the process owners."
the internal control team has developed a follow-up plan for fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 to ensure that management action plans addressing control deficiencies were tracked and implemented in a timely fashion.
"while reports are being produced for each business process, it is not clear if or how the results of these tests are communicated with the departmental senior executives and oversight bodies."
"recommendation #2 the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
"progress update on 2013 oag audit recommendations in the fall of 2013, the department received a report from the office of the auditor general (oag) on their follow-up audit on internal controls over financial reporting."
"at that time, a commitment was made by the department to ensure that the requirements of the pic would be fully implemented in order to address the oag-s recommendations to that end."
"improvements are identified to increase senior management-s awareness and knowledge of the status of icfr through enhanced reporting and communication. additionally, improvements are needed to proactively involve business process owners through effective communication to ensure they understand and fulfil their roles and responsibilities in the icfr process."
"with the completion of the last operating effectiveness testing and the commencement of the on-going monitoring process in fiscal year 2015-16, the management action plans addressing recommendations from oag-s 2013 audit are fully implemented."
"appendix a: icfr process at global affairs canada appendix b: about the audit objective the objective of this audit was to assess whether the internal controls over financial reporting (icfr) process is effective, which ensures that key control gaps are identified and mitigated as needed."
the other objective of this audit was to assess if progress had been made in response to the oag-s 2013 audit recommendations.
the audit criteria were discussed and agreed upon with the auditees.
"senior management, including the deputy minister, is aware of and responsive to their icfr requirements, as per the policy on internal control (pic)."
"a governance structure is defined, implemented, and followed to comply with the pic requirements."
communication to the department is key with a clear -tone from the top- leading to success.
"roles and responsibilities for icfr are defined for, communicated to and followed by business process owner."
an adequate testing methodology for the icfr process exists and is applied consistently across all processes.
a testing methodology for the icfr process exists.
testing methodology is applied correctly for processes under audit scope.
results of key controls testing are documented and communicated to business process owners and senior management for decision/action.
follow-up activities were identified and communicated with the process owners a follow-up process is being implemented by the internal control team.
"the engagement provides an adequate overview of the subject area, which is of value to the organization."
"in order to achieve the intended outcomes, the following approach was used: initial study - gathering and examination of baseline information on pic initiatives, including but not limited to: analyzing non-financial information; and, policies, guidelines and procedures."
the information obtained was used to prepare for the preliminary meetings with senior management.
"preliminary meetings - interviews with the department-s senior management to obtain information related to challenges and delivery of the expected results from a perspective of ensuring that internal audit had a correct understanding of the current state of the process and, importantly, identifying areas of greatest management concern."
key control: a control that provides reasonable assurance that material errors will be prevented or detected in a timely manner.
materiality: extent to which a misstatement or an error of an item of information might reasonably be expected to influence the decision of the user of the financial information.
process owner: ultimately responsible for managing and overseeing the objectives and performance of a process through key performance indicators.
a process owner has the authority and ability to make required changes related to achieving process objectives.
the chief financial officer will report at least twice a year to oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr.
the next presentation will include a reminder of senior management-s responsibility with respect to internal control over financial reporting and a request for senior managers to further communicate this information to their teams.
icfr responsibilities are already included in all ex performance agreements.
"scm september 30, 2017 the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
the chief financial officer will review its communication activities to proactively engage with process owners in the icfr process and provide information on their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control.

the overall conclusion of the audit team is that the process of internal controls over financial reporting is generally effective in identifying and mitigating the risk that the departmental financial statements may be materially misstated.
the department utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls at the department.
audit recommendations: the chief financial officer should provide sufficient and detailed information to the oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr to ensure that their roles and responsibilities as they pertain to the policy on internal control are fulfilled.
"sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were conducted, and evidence gathered, to support the accuracy of the findings and conclusion in this report, and to provide an audit level of assurance."
"the findings and conclusion are based on a comparison of the conditions, as they existed at the time, against pre-established audit criteria that were agreed upon with management and are only applicable to the entity examined and for the scope and time period covered by the audit."
brahim achtoutal date chief audit executive introduction the audit of internal controls over financial reporting was identified as part of the risk-based audit plan for 2016-2019.
"its objective is to ensure that -risks relating to the stewardship of public resources are adequately managed through effective internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting.- the pic states that the deputy heads (deputy ministers (dms)) are responsible for ensuring the establishment, maintenance, monitoring and review of the departmental system of internal controls to mitigate risks in the following broad categories: the effectiveness and efficiency of programs, operations and resource management, including safeguarding of assets; the reliability of financial reporting; and compliance with legislation, regulations, policies and delegated authorities. internal controls over financial reporting (icfr) provide a means by which management and users of financial statements can have confidence that the financial statements fairly reflect financial transactions."
"it is the role of the cfo to provide the dms with reasonable assurance that appropriate measures are taken to maintain an effective system of internal control, including leading the establishment and execution of an assessment plan."
"the icfr process consists of three main phases: risk assessment, control testing, and reporting."
risk assessment the first step of the icfr process is to conduct a risk assessment.
"the risk assessment helps in the development of the annual plan, determining which processes will be examined."
the internal control team completed a risk assessment for all business processes based on the department-s 2013-14 financial statements.
"the assessment on whether the department had an effective system of internal controls was based on the most material business processes grouped as follows: entity level controls (elcs) - present across the department and include measures taken by management to equip staff to adequately manage risks through raising awareness, providing appropriate knowledge and tools as well as developing skills."
it is expected that a risk assessment will be conducted on a periodic basis to ensure that the most material business processes are being assessed.
"control testing following the risk assessment, the internal control team conducts control testing on each of the processes to assess if they are operating effectively."
this step requires that the internal control team identifies the highest risk activities in the business processes and the key controls that would mitigate these risks.
"operating effectiveness testing is used to demonstrate the reliability of the key controls over a period of time, reducing risks related to financial reporting."
ongoing monitoring is defined by the framework as -periodic risk-based assessments as per a multi-year monitoring plan-.
"ongoing monitoring testing includes: the validation of the risks that need to be mitigated; a refresh of the process flowcharts and narratives to ensure that they represent the processes as they are currently functioning; and, an evaluation of the key control activities to confirm that they are still relevant and operating as intended."
observations and recommendations the audit team examined the management practice for the icfr based on the audit criteria described in appendix b.
"based on this work, observations and recommendations were made under the following themes: governance of the icfr process; a risk-based approach to business process selection and key control identification and assessment; and, communication with stakeholders."
"from this work, it was concluded that while sufficient processes and structures exist within the department to meet the governance requirement of the pic, improvement in communications from the cfo would be needed to further engage and obtain support from senior management and the process owners for the implementation of the icfr process."
the audit team confirmed that policies and documents in support of icfr are available for all staff on the department's intranet.
"icfr governance structure the framework designates the departmental audit committee (dac) as the main body responsible for providing objective advice and recommendations to the deputy ministers regarding the adequacy and functioning of the department-s risk management, and control and governance frameworks, including the assessment of the departmental system of icfr."
"though management indicated that verbal presentations were made to executive board, there is no evidence in the records of decision of executive board meetings from march 2015 to september 2016 that such updates on icfr were made."
"it was found that there was no direct reference to, or discussion on, the pic, icfr, or internal controls in general."
"however, as mentioned above, a review of all departmental executive committees- records of decision revealed that only one formal annual report, the financial statements- annex, was presented to one executive committee (the dac)."
"there is no evidence that these testing results were shared with the departmental executive committees, or that testing results were presented in detail in the departmental financial statements- annex."
"by not being fully informed of the results of the risk-based assessment results related to the effectiveness of the departmental system of icfr, there is a risk that the oversight bodies may not be able to effectively discharge their assigned responsibilities defined by the framework, including providing support and communicating periodically to the process owners and staff."
recommendation #1 the chief financial officer should provide sufficient and detailed information to the oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr to ensure that their roles and responsibilities as they pertain to the policy on internal control are fulfilled.
"risk-based approach for process selection, control identification and control assessment as required by the pic, a risk-based approach must be used to assess the effectiveness of the system of internal controls."
the audit team examined the internal control team-s processes to determine if the work was completed using a risk-based approach.
this included examining if a risk-based approach was used to select the key business processes to be reviewed as part of the icfr process and to identify the key controls used to mitigate the processes- risks.
"from this work, it was concluded that a risk-based approach was used for process selection, control identification and control assessment."
"operating effectiveness testing risk-based process selection in fiscal year 2015-16, full-scope operating effectiveness testing was conducted on the transfer payment for development programs process by the internal control team."
it was the most material business process identified in the financial risk assessment and was therefore included as a key business process by the internal control team.
the audit team concludes that this process was chosen using a risk-based approach.
"key controls identification and testing based on validated process documentation, the internal control team conducted a risk assessment on the transfer payments process and identified 21 key controls (14 manual and 7 automated) that were the highest risk to the process."
the audit noted that 13 of the 14 key manual controls were applicable for the sample selected and therefore tested.
the audit team noted that two of the seven key automated controls were not tested as part of this review as they were deemed to be operating effectively in the design effectiveness phase.
"in conclusion, the audit examination confirmed that the key controls were identified based on a risk assessment."
testing results demonstrated that not all controls were operating effectively and therefore not mitigating the risks identified.
"selected key business processes monitoring risk-based process selection as part of the internal control team-s ongoing monitoring program, a three-year rotational testing plan for the key business processes identified in the risk assessment was developed."
the audit team concludes that the business process selection for the icfr ongoing monitoring program was through risk assessment.
key controls identification and testing the audit team noted that the business process documents (e.g. process flowchart and narratives) were validated with the process owners.
the key controls were identified based on the areas of highest risk related to each of the current processes.
detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed to demonstrate how the control activities were functioning and mitigating the risks identified.
mission-specific processes monitoring risk-based mission selection ongoing monitoring of missions- business processes occurs annually as part of the ongoing monitoring program because they were identified in the icfr risk assessment as a high risk control area.
"as a result of this risk assessment, the 15 highest risk missions (from a materiality perspective) were identified."
"in fiscal year 2015-16, the internal control team assessed canada-s mission in mexico city; this was one of the missions identified as being high risk in the assessment."
"additional risk factors that were considered in the selection of mexico city include the fact that the mission had a new financial management officer and management consular officer (mco), and that it was becoming a common service delivery point that will provide financial services to multiple surrounding missions."
"based on these factors, including the mission financial risk assessment, the audit team is in agreement with mexico city-s inclusion in the ongoing monitoring plan."
"these controls, in the form of the mission inventory of risks and key controls, are sent to all heads of mission and mcos."
the audit examination confirmed that the 43 key controls were identified based on a risk assessment.
detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed by the internal control team to demonstrate how controls in mexico city were functioning and mitigating the risks identified.
"key controls over significant risks monitoring risk-based selection as part of the department-s risk-based ongoing monitoring program, there will be annual reviews and testing of key controls over significant risks (kcosr) for those processes determined to be either high or medium risk."
this annual review is based on the internal control team-s risk assessment that identifies the risk level for each process and associated sub-process(s).
kcosrs of medium and high risk processes should be assessed on an annual basis to provide assurance that the department-s system of internal controls are operating as intended.
"with the introduction of the ongoing monitoring program, the internal control team only needs to test the key controls over significant risks that are not tested through an existing testing mechanism, if the mechanism is operating as intended."
"for fiscal year 2015-16, two processes that had high or medium risk sub-processes containing kcosrs were selected for testing: payments at headquarters and year-end procedures."
"for each of the processes, two kcosrs (four in total) were selected based on a detailed risk assessment and tested."
the testing conducted on the key risks was performed using a defined testing methodology similar to the ongoing monitoring methodology.
"overall, the audit team concludes that a risk-based approach is used by the department to identify the business processes to be assessed as part of the icfr process."
a risk-based approach is also used to determine if the business processes are operating as intended.
"instances where communication is key are: during the annual risk & control assessment and on-going business process update; while conducting the ongoing monitoring plan and assessment activities to determine if the system of internal control over financial reporting is effective; upon obtaining the results of the assessments; and, for the development and follow-up on implementation status of the management action plan."
the documentation review and interviews with identified process owners demonstrated that the internal control team communicates with process owners when required at different stages of the icfr process.
"nevertheless, interviews with six out of nine process owners identified a need to clarify their roles, responsibilities, obligations under icfr, and to be sufficiently informed of icfr."
"for example, the audit observed that there is a lack of consistent and clear understanding of the internal controls they are responsible for and how these control activities fit into the annual pic reporting."
"in addition, the audit team noted that the conclusions presented in each of the final testing reports were supported by the testing that was performed by the internal control team or contracted resources."
the need for remediation of control deficiencies is also prioritized according to the highest risk identified during the annual key control over significant risk assessment.
"the assessment results of the business processes are included at a high-level in the annex; however, there is no evidence to support that detailed results are being disseminated to senior management."
senior management is not provided the opportunity to see the complete assessment results and determine if any remedial action is required based on the control deficiencies- level of risk.
"the oag determined that the department was not on track to complete its assessments of internal controls, including addressing gaps and weaknesses, within the identified timelines."
"the department fully implemented the pic requirements in fiscal year end 2015-16, with the completion of operating effectiveness testing of the transfer payments for development programs and the implementation of a risk-based ongoing monitoring program."
overall conclusion the overall conclusion of the audit team is that the process of internal controls over financial reporting is generally effective in identifying and mitigating the risk that the departmental financial statements may be materially misstated.
the department utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
scope the scope of the audit included: operating effectiveness testing - transfer payments for development programs ongoing monitoring of the: entity-level controls process revenues process loans to developing countries and international financial institutions (ifis) investments and advances to ifis ongoing monitoring of mission specific processes ongoing monitoring of key controls over significant risks the audit also assessed the progress made in implementing the recommendations from the fall 2013 oag report.
criteria the following criteria were developed following the completion of the detailed risk assessment and considered the audit criteria related to the management accountability framework developed by the office of comptroller general of the treasury board secretariat.
"the following table outlines the audit criteria developed to meet the stated audit objective and audit scope: criteria sub-criteria accountabilities, roles and responsibilities for the icfr process are formally defined, communicated, exercised, and are supported by an appropriate level of governance structure."
"thorough risk assessments to identify and assess relevant risks are completed, monitored and updated."
an annual risk assessment of the overall icfr process is conducted to ensure highest risk areas are being monitored on an ongoing basis.
a process-level risk assessment was conducted for all processes under the audit scope.
"approach and methodology in order to conclude on the above criteria, and based on identified and assessed key risks and internal controls associated with the related business processes, the audit was completed according to the treasury board policy on internal audit and the audit standards of the institute of internal auditors."
the audit was identified as an audit priority and an area of high risk to global affairs canada in 2016-2019 rbap.
"a risk assessment was completed based on a review of documentation and interviews with stakeholders, including the internal control team (smoc) and a selection of process owners."
"overall, the assessment concluded that the main risks to global affairs canada are related to compliance with the policy on internal control (pic) in-terms of governance of the activity as whole, adequate risk assessments, effective testing, and sufficient follow-up on the gaps identified."
"detailed information gathering - the purpose of this approach was to: record, through interviews and documentation review, the department-s accountability requirements related to the pic and annex; assess through interviews, walkthroughs and documentation review, the level of over-all compliance to the pic; review through interviews and documentation review management-s response to weaknesses identified; and, at the conclusion of the audit, specific areas of interest will be considered for inclusion in the next annual risk-based audit plan."
the observations will assist management to identify potential risks in internal controls over financial reporting the department.
"appendix c: definitions as per the department-s framework for the management of internal control over financial reporting: internal control: a set of means to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance in the following categories: the effectiveness and efficiency of programs, operations and resource management, including safeguarding of assets; the reliability of financial reporting; and, compliance with legislation, regulations, policies, and delegated authorities. internal control over financial reporting: the subset of internal control that allows management and users of financial statements to have reasonable assurance that: transactions are appropriately authorized; financial records are properly maintained; assets are safeguarded; and applicable laws, regulations, and policies are followed."
"the documentation of key controls is done through flowcharts, narratives and control matrices (risk based by business process)."

this section provides the observations resulting from the audit work carried out.
the recommendation addressing these audit findings is located in the section following these observations.
compliance with legislation and regulations is inadequate.
important issues are identified that could negatively impact the achievement of program/operational objectives.
compliance with central agency/departmental policies and established procedures is inadequate.
issues are identified that could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
low controls are in place but the level of compliance varies.
compliance with central agency/departmental policies and established procedures varies.
issues identified are less significant but opportunities that could enhance operations exist.
"governance contributes to the strategic direction, oversight, decision-making, and accountability for an organization to successfully meet its objectives."
"further, while the mou guidelines identify some -accountable directorates or regions-, they do not specifically indicate what the accountabilities are or provide mechanisms for holding those directorates or regions accountable."
"finally, the chief financial officer (cfo) sector has a center of expertise (coe) in place along with the regional finance groups to help fulfill some of the roles and responsibilities of the cfo regarding partnerships and collaboration."
this coe currently consists of one employee.
"while the coe sees its role as primarily related to providing financial expertise and not covering mou, interviews found that others in the department have a much broader expectation of the coe, including all types of advice and direction related to partnerships and collaborations."
"the strategic policy sector used to have responsibility for mou, which may be contributing to the misunderstanding of roles, responsibilities and accountabilities."
"similarly, clear accountabilities help ensure agreements are properly implemented in line with policies and procedures and that goals and objectives are achieved."
oversight oversight at the program or regional level is not consistent across all phases of the partnerships and collaborations process and there is no oversight at the departmental level it was expected that an oversight function for partnerships and collaborations has been established and is operating effectively.
"currently, there is no treasury board or departmental policy that requires oversight for partnerships and collaborations at the departmental level."
the dfo directive on collaborations requires that a program level oversight function be established for reviewing proposed collaborative projects to ensure they comply with the directive.
"within the ecosystems and oceans science (eos) sector, where the majority of agreements related to partnerships and collaborations in the department reside, the sector recently created the office of partnerships and collaboration to provide oversight for these types of agreements."
"while this office is still being established, it is expected to act as a hub for partnerships and collaborations for eos, by providing employees expert advice and assistance in moving partnerships and collaborations through all phases of the agreement process."
"prior to the creation of this office, the sector-s only oversight mechanism was the science executive committee."
"while the office of partnerships and collaboration is specific to the eos sector, the canadian coast guard and other sectors within dfo have expressed interest in expanding their use of partnerships and collaborations, which would increase the need for a broader oversight function."
this finding is important because effective departmental oversight can help ensure partnerships and collaborations are aligned with departmental priorities and objectives.
"the department has also set up two intranet sites, one for collaborative agreements and another for mou."
"these intranet sites provide easy access to policies, procedures, tools and templates."
"the department also has two groups identified as providing support to partnerships and collaborations: a center of expertise (coe) within the cfo sector, and the office of partnerships and collaboration within the eos sector."
"interviewees mentioned that they often have difficulty with the lengthy partnerships and collaborations processes, as it is not part of their regularly assigned work."
"further, most programs and regions do not have staff dedicated to partnerships and collaborations to help move the arrangements through the processes."
"specifically, there are often lengthy discussions on which tool to use."
"also, the array and titles of current templates may be adding to the confusion for users."
"for example, collaborative agreement templates with other departments or levels of government are called mou templates but are expected to go through the collaborative agreements process according to the directive on collaboration."
this has also contributed to delays in finalizing some agreements.
"as part of the case studies, the time it took to complete each step of the approval process (from application to the signing of the agreement) was documented along with the time it took to get through the entire process up to signing of the agreement or mou."
"overall, it was found that the agreement that took the least amount of time was a collaborative agreement with another federal department that was completed in 115 days and the longest was a collaborative agreement with a non-government organization that took 445 days to complete."
"the main causes of the delays were related to confusion over the process and or which template to use, negotiations with external collaborators, navigating through the department-s and the external collaborator-s distinct processes and templates, oversight committee approvals and the requirement for reviews by subject matter experts."
"when there are adequate resources and clear guidance available on processes, tools and templates employees are able to successfully fulfill their roles and responsibilities, and enter into agreements in a timely basis to benefit from partnerships and collaborations that support the department-s goals and objectives."
"specifically, in the case studies, it was found that these forms were completed about 75% of the time, and there were inconsistencies in how they were completed, their level of rigour and accuracy."
"specifically, gaps in controls and some duplication were found."
"currently, all collaborative agreements must go through the same process, regardless of whether it is a renewal of an agreement with a long-term collaborator, an agreement with another federal department, or a brand new agreement with an organization the department has never dealt with in the past."
"the only part of the process for collaborative agreements that varies between agreements is the signing authorities, which are based solely on dollar amounts and the expert groups that need to be contacted."
"similarly, the level of controls for mou are comparable to those seen in the collaborative agreement process despite the fact that mou are with other departments or governments and do not include any transfer of funds or in-kind contributions."
this was supported by interviewees who expressed that many of the controls in place imposed costs on the process beyond the benefit they produced.
these included controls such as the requirement for all partnerships and collaborations to obtain approval to negotiate before discussions with the potential partner begin and the need to have all collaborative agreements go through the regional or sector oversight committees as well as regional or sector management.
this suggests that the decision to increase signing authorities was consistent with better alignment of costs with benefits.
"access to relevant, accurate and timely information is required to meet the department-s objectives."
"well-functioning information systems generate better decision-making, better compliance with policies and fewer problems."
"the main information system for partnerships and collaborations in the department is iagree, a standalone database."
interviewees also mentioned that iagree had technical issues including not properly refreshing after viewing files and retaining previous information when validating or making changes to an agreement.
"specifically, the aboriginal programs & governance information system, which houses contribution agreements along with basic client relationship management functions and performance measurement tracking, and icontribute, which is the departmental database used to manage grants and contributions, were mentioned."
"these findings are important because access to relevant, accurate and timely information, allows management to make informed decisions in support of departmental goals and objectives."
effective monitoring includes ensuring that deficiencies are communicated to management and are addressed in a timely manner.
monitoring promotes better alignment with departmental goals and objectives and that issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner.
"in addition, it requires that a short progress report be prepared annually and at the end of the agreement detailing the activities and achievements of the mou."
"similarly, the directive on collaboration identifies the cfo as being responsible for -monitoring internal management practices and taking necessary action to maintain a robust environment of internal control to address any instance of non-compliance- and that regional directors of finance and senior finance managers implement a standardized monitoring program for collaborative agreements to ensure they comply with the directive."
"also, none of these cases had any evidence that the progress reports were used or reported beyond the project authority to allow for identification of common issues or ensure expected results were achieved."
some alignment of monitoring with departmental objectives was found in that the oversight committees review collaborative agreement applications to ensure they are aligned with one of the department-s business lines.
it was expected that issues identified as a result of monitoring processes would be corrected in a timely manner.
"the mou guidelines state that if areas of improvement are identified during progress reporting, there may be a requirement to revisit the mou to determine how to make it more effective."
"also, the annual mou monitoring report requires that remedial measures be identified for deficiencies for each mou."
"according to interviews with senior management, there is no formal mechanism in place to ensure that issues are identified and remedied in a timely manner."
this finding is significant because a monitoring system in place that is linked to departmental objectives and remediates issues in a timely manner helps ensure alignment with departmental goals and objectives.
recommendation and management action plan it is recommended that the cfo coordinate a working group of sectors and the ccg to develop a management control framework for partnerships and collaborations.
management response: the cfo agrees to coordinate and lead a working group of sectors and the ccg to develop a management control framework for partnerships and collaborations.
"while there is oversight for individual mou and agreements, governance at the departmental level can be improved to ensure that they are properly managed."
the monitoring program at the agreement and departmental level could also be strengthened to ensure issues are identified in a timely manner.
the extent of the examination was planned to provide a reasonable level of assurance with respect to the audit criteria.
the opinion is applicable only to the entity examined and within the scope described herein.
the evidence was gathered in compliance with the treasury board policy and directive on internal audit.
"the audit conforms with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
the procedures used meet the professional standards of the institute of internal auditors.
"appendix a: lines of enquiry and audit criteria the audit criteria are presented in the table below, by audit line of enquiry."
audit criteria line of enquiry 1 - governance (control environment) criterion 1.1: an oversight function for partnerships and collaborative arrangements has been established and is operating effectively.
"criterion 1.2: roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities are defined, documented, communicated, and understood."
line of enquiry 4 - information and communication criterion 4.1: information systems in place provide management with accurate and reliable information to support decision making in the management of partnerships and collaborative arrangements. line of enquiry 5 - monitoring criterion 5.1: a monitoring process or system is in place that is linked to departmental objectives and identifies and remediates deficiencies in a timely manner.
"while the audit was conducted based on the lines of enquiry and audit criteria identified in the planning phase, this report is structured along the following main themes: governance; risks and controls; information systems; and monitoring."
"based on the audit work performed and our professional judgment, the risk associated with each observation was rated using a three-point scale."
"the risk ranking (high, moderate, low) is based on the level of potential risk exposure we feel may have an impact on the achievement of fisheries and oceans canada objectives, and is indicative of the priority management should give to the observation."
the following criteria were used in determining the risk exposure: high controls are not in place or are inadequate.
moderate controls are in place but are not being sufficiently complied with.
"governance (moderate risk) governance is the combination of processes and structures implemented by management to inform, direct, manage and monitor the activities of the department toward the achievement of its objectives."
"the audit found that the department has a directive and guideline in place that identifies roles, responsibilities and processes for collaborative agreements."
"for example, the chief financial officer-s responsibilities include: directing the development, implementation and communication of the directive; developing training material, templates, guidelines, procedures and controls for the implementation of the directive; establishing a robust framework of effective management practices and controls to mitigate risks and provide assurance with respect to compliance with legislation, regulations, policies, directives and delegated authorities, for departmental collaboration; and monitoring internal management practices and taking necessary action(s) to maintain a robust environment of internal control and to address any instance of non-compliance."
"these findings were confirmed by interviewees who, while generally able to articulate what their roles and responsibilities were in relation to collaborative agreements, were not able to identify their accountabilities beyond general financial management."
"this finding is important because defined, documented and understood roles and responsibilities help ensure that processes are completed as intended and reduce the risk of duplication and inefficiencies."
"overall, the audit found that while there is some oversight at a program or sector level, there is no oversight function or mechanism at the departmental level that is able to monitor issues or practices from across the department to ensure consistency and co-ordination in the management and implementation of agreements."
"it could also improve the department-s ability to provide effective strategic direction, allocate appropriate resources, analyze activities related to exposure to risk and determine suitable mitigation strategies."
"finally, departmental level oversight reduces the risk that broad cross-region or sector issues will be missed."
"information, tools and processes employees do not have access to sufficient, clear information to carry out their roles and responsibilities and tools and processes are not well understood it was expected that employees would have the necessary training, tools, resources and information needed to successfully carry out their roles and responsibilities with respect to partnerships and collaborations."
"the audit found that the department has policies, procedures, tools and templates related to partnerships and collaborations that provide information and guidance."
"while the coe and office of partnerships and collaboration provide access to expertise in the area of collaborative agreements, regions and the coe identified a lack of resources as one of the main limiting factors in carrying out partnerships and collaborations roles and responsibilities."
"finally, the audit found that there was a general lack of understanding on how to use the tools and templates."
"based on the case studies and interviews, it was found that employees do not understand the process well, especially which templates should be used."
"this is not clear to many users and as a result, they are not consistently using the right template, process or both."
risks and controls (moderate risk) the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) defines risk as the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of objectives.
risk assessment involves a dynamic and iterative process for identifying and assessing risks to the achievement of objectives.
control activities are the actions established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management-s directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out.
controls are to be based on risks identified as being unacceptable and should be designed to bring the risk to an acceptable level.
"according to treasury board-s guide to integrated risk management, risk management -involves a systematic approach to setting the best course of action under uncertainty by identifying, assessing, understanding, making decisions on, and communicating risk issues.- no evidence of a systematic approach to risk for partnerships and collaborations was found."
"at the departmental level, the corporate risk profile (crp) was identified as the main risk management tool."
"while the crp does identify one risk area related to partnerships and collaborations, that of -program delivery risk-, only two of the identified action plans address items related to partnerships and collaborations and in both cases were for specific programs."
"also, while the crp is an annual exercise to identify the top risks for the department, the risk mitigation strategies are not actively monitored and the crp is not revisited until it is updated for the following year."
"as such, the crp is not an effective risk management tool for partnerships and collaborations."
"aside from the crp, no listing of key risks, or evidence of risk assessments for the partnerships and collaborations functions as a whole were found."
"further, the audit found that while risk assessments were completed for some agreements and mou, they assessed project specific risks, and were not rolled up to an overall risk assessment."
"specifically, the dfo mou guidelines require that an impact assessment be conducted for each mou to ensure that risks associated with the mou are identified and considered."
"while the impact assessment has some specific risk requirements to consider at the departmental level, when a separate sample of 5 impact assessments from ekme was selected and reviewed, inconsistencies in how they were completed and the rigour undertaken to complete the assessments were identified."
"similarly, the directive on collaboration requires that the impact of collaborative agreements on the department-s risk profile be properly evaluated, addressed and mitigated and senior management be informed of the impacts of risks that cannot be fully addressed or mitigated."
"this finding is important because identifying departmental risks helps ensure controls are appropriately based on those risks and allows management to determine which risks to accept, mitigate, or avoid."
"since no departmental level risk assessments for partnerships and collaborations were found, in order to test the alignment of controls to risks, the partnerships and collaborations processes were examined to identify possible key risks and compare them to the controls in place."
no other documentation was found to show that the controls were risk-based.
"also, while the directive states that monitoring of the directive -will be based on the principles of risk management-, no evidence was found to support that this was occurring."
"further, no evidence was found to demonstrate that the level of risk associated with an arrangement was considered in determining the process to be followed."
"finally, it was found that mou must go through many of the same controls regardless of whether the mou is with another federal department or an international government, despite significantly different risk levels."
"in examining costs versus benefits, no evidence was found during the audit to demonstrate that costs and benefits were considered in developing and implementing controls."
"although no evidence of cost benefit analysis was found, the financial signing authority levels for collaborative agreements were amended during the audit period to allow for increased signing authorities for collaborative agreements."
this finding is important because strong alignment of controls to risks reduces the likelihood of having an ineffective and inefficient system of controls.
information systems (moderate risk) coso states that the presence of an effective information system is a key component of a strong internal control structure.
the information system in place does not provide management with accurate and reliable information to support decision making in the management of partnerships and collaborative arrangements it was expected that the department would have in place an effective information system that would house partnerships and collaborations- data and would provide management with accurate and complete information for decision-making.
"to test for completeness of iagree, the ten case studies were examined to see if they were in iagree along with the required tombstone data and mandatory documentation in accordance with the mou guidelines and directive on collaboration. however, it was found that four of the ten case studies had not been entered into iagree."
while the percentage of arrangements missing from iagree cannot be applied to the database as a whole; additional testing based on mou and contribution agreements found in ekme also revealed significant numbers of missing arrangements.
"overall, it was not possible to determine how many agreements may not be in iagree, as the department does not currently have a reliable list of all partnerships and collaborations."
"similarly, financial data in some fields was not consistently entered correctly, such as entering the full value when it was supposed to be entered in thousands of dollars."
"also, based on interviews, it was found that several regions maintain their own spreadsheets and files to monitor their arrangements because iagree does not have sufficient functionality for their reporting and monitoring needs."
"specifically, iagree does not provide recent financial data, permit easy extraction of information in a useable format, or contain all the fields that are needed by the regions to effectively manage the agreements."
"finally, some interviewees stated that there are other data repositories that are used in the department that could be more useful and allow for more inclusion of key documents and correspondence."
"further, a reliable information system enables effective risk management and ensures compliance with policies."
monitoring (moderate risk) monitoring involves evaluating partnerships and collaborations against criteria established by regulators or management.
"finally, monitoring ensures that individual partnerships and collaborations, as well as partnerships and collaborations as a whole are being carried out according to plan, are appropriately managed and are on track to meet objectives."
the audit found that the mou guidelines require that indicators be developed to assess the agreement-s progress in accomplishing its objectives and that costs and resources to implement and maintain the mou be tracked.
"however, in the case studies, while all three mou type arrangements should have had a completed progress report, none did."
"further, there was no evidence that progress reports, or issues identified within a progress report, are consistently reported to appropriate management."
"during the audit, it was found that the cfo sector monitors the funds received by the department from cost-sharing agreements and specified purpose account agreements to ensure funds are appropriately accounted for and managed; however, no evidence of departmental monitoring was found related to internal management practices and compliance, neither was any implementation of a standardized monitoring program by the regional directors and senior finance managers found."
"further, inconsistent monitoring of the collaborative agreements was found in the case studies."
"of the seven collaborative agreements, four had progressed to a point where a progress report should have been completed; however, only three of those four had completed progress reports."
"however, there was no evidence of monitoring to ensure progress or results were in line with departmental objectives."
"further, all monitoring was of individual arrangements, no evidence of monitoring of partnerships and collaborations as a whole for alignment with departmental objectives was found."
the directive on collaboration does not provide any direction regarding issue identification and remediation and there was no evidence found in the audit of issues being raised from monitoring of collaborative agreements or mou.
"finally, no evidence was found to suggest that issues identified for mou and collaborative agreements are being consolidated to identify overarching trends for the department."
this control framework should ensure there is an effective information management system in place and include a streamlined suite of tools and processes that are risk based and balance cost versus benefits.
"the working group will review existing tools, processes and systems to ensure an effective information management system is in place and a streamlined, risk-based suite of tools and processes that balance cost versus benefits is implemented."
"target completion date: march 31, 2018 audit opinion the audit found that there are opportunities for improvement to ensure that the department has an adequate control framework to support partnerships and collaborative arrangements."
opportunities exist to enhance the partnerships and collaborations risk management system and approval process to ensure that controls are risk based.
"statement of conformance in my professional judgment as chief audit executive, sufficient and appropriate audit procedures have been conducted and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the opinion provided and contained in this report."
"the opinion is based on a comparison of the conditions, as they existed at the time, against pre-established audit criteria that were agreed on with management."
the evidence gathered was sufficient to provide senior management with proof of the opinion derived from the internal audit.
"criterion 1.3: employees have the necessary training, tools, resources, and information to successfully carry out their responsibilities with respect to partnerships and collaborative arrangements. line of enquiry 2 - risk management criterion 2.1: an effective risk management system is in place to identify, analyze and manage risk, involves appropriate levels of management, and considers the acceptable tolerance level in relation to objectives."
"line of enquiry 3 - internal control system and activities criterion 3.1: control activities are aligned with key risks, consider costs versus benefits, and are conducted in a timely and consistent manner."
"control framework over the acquisition card program a policy framework is in place, and roles, responsibilities and accountabilities are well defined, communicated, and adequately supported by procedural documents."
"a control framework includes clear policies and procedures, clear roles and responsibilities, training and safeguard controls over the issuance and cancellation of cards."
"key among these documents are the directive on acquisition cards, standard on the use of acquisition cards and, the procurement to payment process for acquisition card purchases under $10,000."
"the documents are available on the agency-s intranet, and are current and consistent in all key respects, with the policy, requirements and expectations as set out by treasury board."
the cfia policy and guidance documents clearly outline the responsibilities of key stakeholders in the acquisition card program.
"in addition, the nacc provides active support to all users."
"there are effective controls in place for card management relating to issuance, credit limits, tracking and cancellation of acquisition cards."
"we examined the processes for administration of the acquisition card program covering issuance, setting credit card limits, and cancellation of cards."
the centralization of card management responsibilities under the office of the nacc is a strong overall control in ensuring process consistency and effectiveness.
"cards are issued only after key policy requirements are met, including responsibility centre manager (rcm) signed authorization, provision of training to the prospective card holders, and signed acknowledgement of responsibilities by the card holder."
the nacc maintains a current log of acquisition cards and is diligent in tracking limit changes.
"incidences of compromised, lost, or stolen cards are also tracked and reported to senior management as part of regular reporting."
"for the sample of departures tested, the card was cancelled by the nacc immediately upon receipt of notification by the rcm and / or cardholder."
compliance the agency-s acquisition card usage and transactions are generally in compliance with the policy framework.
rcms have a critical role to play in ensuring the integrity of the purchase process through the use of acquisition cards.
"managers are accountable for purchases, both before and after the transaction takes place."
"cmb, through its account payable centres, reviews the transaction to exercise payment authority under section 33 of the faa."
managers are required to sign off on a monthly reconciliation of credit card transactions.
their signature signifies their accountability under section 34 of the faa that the goods and services have been received.
we tested compliance with the key controls/requirements of the faa and the tb directive on account verification using a sample of 126 transactions that were selected by using targeted and random methods of sampling.
these percentages are only slightly lower than cmb-s targeted compliance rate for critical errors.
"in addition, we tested the sample for certain procedures and best practices that are agency-specific, described in the standard on the use of acquisition cards which is the compliance instrument intended to regulate the use and administration of acquisition cards."
"non-compliance against procedural requirements may reduce the agency-s ability to ensure compatibility with its it networks, properly track assets and demonstrate good value."
"recommendation 1: the vice president, corporate management branch should reconfirm standard procedures and best practices on the use of acquisition cards, and communicate these to managers and card holders to ensure awareness."
the monitoring procedures are documented and activities are undertaken in a consistent manner.
"follow up is taken where potential instances of non-compliance related to expenditure eligibility, use of the card by someone other than the card holder, or potential transaction splitting practices are identified."
"as part of these reports, the nacc also provides various metrics on the acquisition card program including but not limited to: spending by branch, top vendors by amount, and instances of lost or stolen cards."
the plan allows for the potential random selection of acquisition card transactions as part of the sample reviewed.
the audit tested the quality assurance and monitoring activities undertaken by accounting operations by reviewing 29 transactions that had been subjected to monthly monitoring procedures and 20 transactions that were part of the quarterly non-pay quality assurance testing.
"these include obtaining quotes, obtaining equipment numbers for low-value assets and consulting with imit branch for it related purchases."
active monitoring or introducing other mechanisms to ensure compliance related to the above aspects of the policy would reinforce desired actions to be taken by cardholders and rcms.
monitoring is generally a manual process.
"for example, the review of the population of transactions and selecting the sample for testing is primarily a manual process for accounting operations and exclusively manual for nacc."
"maximizing the use of available computer applications in selecting the samples could lead to improved efficiency by automating the methods to detect and monitor certain behavior, and by allowing for repeat tests that can be run on the data at any time."
"recommendation 2: the vice president, corporate management branch should consider enhancing its quality assurance and monitoring activities by: expanding the use of data analytics expanding monitoring or introducing other mechanisms to ensure compliance with the cfia standard on the use of acquisition cards."
"the treasury board directive on acquisition cards requires that chief financial officers establish risk-based management practices and controls (control framework) to ensure economical, efficient and secure use of acquisition cards."
the audit found that the agency has in place a suite of policy and guidance documents for acquisition cards.
we also noted that there are mechanisms in place to support understanding of the policies and related requirements.
"the audit found that the issuance procedures are followed, limits are dully approved and card cancellations take place in a timely manner."
testing of card cancellation confirmed that card holders and rcms are diligent in informing the nacc of cardholder departures so that the card can be cancelled in a timely manner.
"specifically, we tested that expenditures were: properly pre-authorized (s. 32 faa) approved by the delegated financial authority (s. 34 faa) supported by complete documentation as required by the treasury board directive on account verification we noted that from the total of 126 expenditures tested, 93% were appropriately pre-authorized (s.32) and 95% were appropriately approved (s.34) by a valid delegated financial authority."
"further, a review of supporting documentation showed a level of compliance of 92% regarding the requirement to maintain appropriate supporting documentation with reference to proof of services rendered or goods received."
"the audit found the following: pre-approval for it assets - 2 out of 2 (100%) identified did not obtain imit-s pre-approval quotes for goods and services - 12 out of 38 (32%) did not obtain quotes as recommended by the standard assets exceeding $1,000 reported for tracking purposes - 11 out of 16 (69%) did not contact assets management for determination of asset identification requirement."
"overall, compliance against these procedural requirements is low. it is also noted that cmb does not monitor for compliance to procedural requirements."
monitoring and reporting risk-based quality assurance and monitoring activities are undertaken.
"however, monitoring could be enhanced through strengthening data analytics and expanding to cover all policy requirements."
"in accordance with the tb directive on account verification, financial officers are responsible for exercising payment authority (s. 33 of the faa) and implementing a risk-based quality assurance and monitoring activity."
the audit found that nacc carries out monthly monitoring.
monitoring results are appropriately summarized and included in the formal reports provided within a reasonable time frame to senior management.
accounting operations undertakes quarterly monitoring as part of its risk-based quality assurance plan over account verification for non-pay expenditures.
"in addition to this, accounting operations also undertakes monthly risk-based monitoring specifically of acquisition card transactions."
this monitoring includes transactions identified as -high risk- and is aimed to ensure that use of the card by all acquisition card holders is tested over a four year cycle.
the results of the testing confirmed that monitoring and quality assurance is undertaken pursuant to established processes.
"however, audit testing and interviews confirmed that there are certain aspects of the acquisition card policy suite that are not subject to monitoring."
"in addition, we noted in our sample work that complete documentation supporting receipt of goods was not always available from the card holder or the delegated manager in support of section 34 approval."
"although data analytics software applications with data mining and analysis functionality are available, they are not used to their fullest potential in the monitoring/qa processes."
"furthermore, we expected that there would be a documented, approved and communicated materiel management framework in place."
"the framework included the following instruments: draft directive for ssc materiel -inventory and disposal- management; draft standard for ssc materiel inventory control; draft standard for ssc materiel stocktaking; draft standard for ssc materiel transfer, loan and donation; draft standard for ssc materiel disposal; and materiel management governance structure."
we expected that the roles and responsibilities for the management of it assets would be documented and communicated.
"once approved, the intention was to communicate the framework organization-wide on the ssc website."
"at the time of the audit, no communication plan had been developed."
the tb policy on management of materiel stated that deputy heads were responsible for ensuring that a materiel management framework was in place to ensure that materiel was managed by departments in a sustainable and financially responsible manner.
"further delays in the approval, communication and implementation of the framework would result in non-compliance with tb requirements."
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services, and chief financial officer, should ensure the framework for ssc materiel -inventory and disposal- management is approved, implemented and communicated."
"recommendation 1 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services, and chief financial officer, should ensure the framework for ssc materiel -inventory and disposal- management is approved, implemented and communicated."
management response: management agrees with this recommendation.
the materiel management framework was reviewed by the senior management board in december 2015 and approved by the president of ssc in april 2016.
a communique will be sent to ssc employees in july 2016 to announce the approval of the materiel management framework.
processes for the lifecycle management of information technology assets we expected that ssc would have processes in place for the lifecycle management of it assets which met the applicable policies and directives.
"recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, service delivery and management, should update ssc-s information technology asset management (itam) processes for all information technology assets and develop and implement a communication plan to inform ssc employees outside of service asset and configuration management of their roles and responsibilities pertaining to itam."
"recommendation 2 the senior assistant deputy minister, service delivery and management, should update ssc-s information technology asset management (itam) processes for all information technology assets and develop and implement a communication plan to inform ssc employees outside of service asset and configuration management of their roles and responsibilities pertaining to itam."
management response: ssc management agrees with the recommendation.
service management will update itam processes for all it assets.
a communications plan will be developed to inform ssc employees of their roles and responsibilities related to itam.
"recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister (sadm), corporate services, and chief financial officer, and sadm, service delivery and management, should implement effective controls to ensure that procured information technology assets are recorded, managed and disposed of in accordance with ssc procedures."
"recommendation 3 the senior assistant deputy minister (sadm), corporate services, and chief financial officer, and sadm, service delivery and management, should implement effective controls to ensure that procured information technology assets are recorded, managed and disposed of in accordance with ssc procedures."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation.
"the sadm, corporate services, and chief financial officer, and the sadm, service delivery and management, will coordinate efforts and implement effective controls to ensure that procured it assets are recorded, managed and disposed of in accordance with ssc procedures."
ssc will implement effective controls that include integration between the financial system and it asset tracking tools.
ssc used two different software systems for the lifecycle management of it assets (i.e. ecd and hp asset manager).
"ecd was used to track enterprise assets which consisted namely of: infrastructure hardware, servers, networks, switches, etc. hp asset manager was used for legacy hardware, as well as for desktops, laptops, software and other end-user assets."
"sacm identified and documented, through business rules, which fields and information were required to track and manage the lifecycle of it assets."
"reports were generated from the ecd and hp asset manager databases containing all ssc assets up to june 30, 2015, were reviewed as part of the audit."
we compared this data to the information identified as required by sacm.
"in addition, we identified weaknesses with some of the automated controls in the tools: generic options were available in system enforced drop-down fields, such as -please select a value- or -unknown-; and certain required fields allowed a blank entry."
"after finding the above inconsistencies with location fields in ecd, we conducted an inventory validation exercise at one ssc location."
"recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, service delivery and management, should confirm the information required to manage the lifecycle of information technology assets, update the business rules to be consistent with this information and ensure proper controls are in place to ensure that the information is being captured in a consistent and accurate manner."
"recommendation 4 the senior assistant deputy minister, service delivery and management, should confirm the information required to manage the lifecycle of information technology assets, update the business rules to be consistent with this information and ensure proper controls are in place to ensure that the information is being captured in a consistent and accurate manner."
management response: management agrees with the recommendation.
"information required to support it lifecycle management will be reviewed, and business rules will be updated to support consistent and accurate asset tracking."
ssc is committed to making the necessary changes to it asset management tools and processes in support of effective it asset management.
monitoring of the management of information technology assets we expected that ssc would have mechanisms in place for monitoring and reporting on the management of it assets.
tb policy framework for the management of assets and acquired services required deputy heads to ensure that practices were in place for asset management within the department and that monitoring and reporting on the management of materiel occurred.
"a delay in the approval of the framework was impeding the development of metrics, indicators and the reporting of these indicators affecting the ability of the deputy head to monitor and report on the management of materiel at ssc and results in non-compliance with tb requirements."
"recommendation 5 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services, and chief financial officer, should ensure that measurement indicators are developed for monitoring and reporting on the framework for ssc materiel -inventory and disposal- management."
"recommendation 5 the senior assistant deputy minister, corporate services, and chief financial officer, should ensure that measurement indicators are developed for monitoring and reporting on the framework for ssc materiel -inventory and disposal- management."
management response: management agrees with this recommendation.
"measurement indicators will be developed for monitoring and reporting on ssc-s materiel management governance structure (internal policy instruments: directive and standards associated to inventory control, stocktaking, transfer, loan, donation and disposal)."
conclusion the objective of the audit was to provide assurance on the adequacy of itam at ssc and to ensure compliance with government policies and ssc procedures.
"we identified several issues with the processes and controls that impacted ssc-s ability to provide assurance that all enterprise assets (hardware and software) were being adequately managed. without awareness of all the assets that the department owns (legacy and enterprise), ssc is not able to ensure that it is effectively managing the lifecycle of all of its assets."
"management response overall management response management agrees with all the findings, conclusions, and recommendations."
actions will be taken to ensure compliance with the tb policy framework for the management of assets and acquired services and the tb policy on management of materiel.
"clear roles and responsibilities will be communicated in parallel to the implementation of the material management internal policy instruments (directive and standards) associated with inventory control, stocktaking, transfer, loan, donation and disposal."
"while there are existing processes and controls in place, ssc-s itam processes for all it assets will be developed and a communication plan will be implemented to inform ssc employees outside of sacm of their roles and responsibilities pertaining to itam."
ssc has processes in place for the lifecycle management of it assets which meet the applicable policies and directives.
shared services canada-s information technology asset management governance structure we expected ssc to have a governance structure in place to ensure that it assets were managed appropriately and in compliance with government of canada and ssc policies.
we found that ssc developed a draft framework for ssc material -inventory and disposal- management (framework).
we found that the draft framework and instruments were in line with applicable requirements as set out in the tb policy framework for the management of assets and acquired services and the tb policy on management of materiel.
"we found the roles and responsibilities for the management of it assets were documented in the draft framework and the accompanying directive, standards and materiel management governance structure."
"however, at the time of this audit the framework had not yet been approved."
we found that stakeholders were consulted and improvements were made to the framework to reflect the comments received throughout the consultation process.
we found delays in the submission and presentation of the framework for approval to the corporate management board which was in most part due to the reorganization and consultations with various stakeholders.
"furthermore, the absence of a documented and communicated governance structure for itam could impact the department-s operational ability to manage the lifecycle of its it assets and damage its reputation as a responsible steward of crown property."
"we found that since the reorganization on april 1, 2015, ssc centralized its itam function under the responsibility of sacm."
"we found that ssc had some documented processes and controls for the purchasing, receiving, tagging, recording and disposing of it assets."
"however, these processes were mainly designed for use within sacm and were only communicated to the group internally."
"although the sacm directorate was using their documented processes, updates were required to reflect organizational changes and general updates."
"for example, the disposal processes required updates to reflect additional types of disposal that had not been previously documented and the user guide for the enterprise control desk (ecd) tracking tool also required updates to align with the latest version of the software that was in use."
there were no controls in place to enforce sacm-s involvement in the itam function.
"therefore, ssc employees may not be aware of the requirement to contact itam at different points in the lifecycle."
"prior to the centralization of the itam function, there were no standard processes or tracking tools which resulted in a lack of visibility of all it assets that were transferred to ssc when the department was established."
"as a result, we found that ssc could not provide assurance that all of ssc-s legacy it assets were adequately managed."
there was no integration between the financial system (sigma) and the it asset tracking tools (ecd and hp asset manager).
sacm had documented a manual process to monitor sigma for new it asset purchases because there was no assurance that sacm was notified when new it assets were purchased.
"due to the manual nature of this process and the reliance on proper financial coding, there was a risk that all newly purchased it assets may not be identified through this process."
"in addition, although there was a project underway to identify and address the gaps for certain desktop software, there was no control in place to prevent ssc from issuing more desktop software licenses than were purchased."
"overall, ssc was unable to provide assurance that the lifecycle of all software assets was appropriately managed. without awareness of all the assets that the department owns (legacy and enterprise), ssc is not able to ensure that it is effectively managing the lifecycle of all of its it assets."
information to support the lifecycle management of information technology assets we expected ssc to have accurate and sufficient information to support the management of it assets throughout their lifecycle.
"however, we found problems in the accuracy and sufficiency of the information available to support the management of it assets."
we found some controls in place to help ensure the required information collected was accurate and sufficient.
"however, there were several weaknesses identified in the controls that impacted the accuracy and sufficiency of the information captured in both tools: the business rules were very general and did not specify which specific field(s) in either system should be populated (e.g. the business rules state -location- is required, but there are multiple fields in the systems that contain location-type information); there was additional information identified as important by sacm that was not captured in the business rules; and there were automated, system enforced controls for the collection of some required information, but not all."
"we found that the location fields (i.e. codes, descriptions, tower, floor and room) were not enforced in ecd and although some location fields were enforced in hp asset manager, there were cases where the combined information populated in the location fields in both systems did not provide accurate or sufficient information to locate some assets."
"we found that: of the assets that were visible (i.e. in hallways and boardrooms), there were 60 assets that were required to be tagged and tracked in the system; of 60 (58%) assets should have had asset tags but either did not or they were not visible; of the 25 asset tags we identified, 18 were ssc tags and 6 were public works and government services canada tags; and only one asset was found in ecd and none in hp asset manager."
ssc did not have its own asset tags at the outset which resulted in assets being tagged with other department tags (even if they were considered ssc assets).
"in addition, there were no centralized processes, tools or controls in place to track any assets that were tagged even after ssc received their own asset tags."
the lack of visibility of all it assets combined with the process and control weaknesses resulted in ssc-s inability to provide accurate and sufficient information to monitor the management of all it assets throughout their lifecycle.
"we found that ssc-s draft framework stated that the chief information officer (cio) was responsible for developing, maintaining, implementing measurement indicators and data collection tools for the framework and for reporting on them."
"however, we found no systematic monitoring was taking place in relation to the overall management of it assets at ssc; the cio planned to develop metrics once the framework was approved."
we found that ssc developed a draft framework for ssc material -inventory and disposal- management and that the framework and instruments were in line with applicable requirements as set out in the tb policy framework for the management of assets and acquired services and the tb policy on management of materiel.
"however, it was neither approved nor communicated."
we found that stakeholders were consulted and improvements were made to the framework to reflect the comments received throughout the consultation process.
"however, there had been insufficient communication regarding roles and responsibilities and the centralization of the itam function."
we found deficiencies in the accuracy and sufficiency of the information available to support and monitor the management of it assets.
there were inconsistencies in the identification of what information was required for the lifecycle management of it assets and the controls in place to ensure the required information was captured in the appropriate tracking tool.
we found that there was no systematic monitoring taking place in relation to the overall management of it assets at ssc; the cio planned to develop metrics once the framework was approved.
annex a: audit criteria the following audit criteria were used in the conduct of this audit: ssc has a governance structure in place to ensure that it assets are managed appropriately and in compliance with government of canada and ssc policies.
ssc tracks its it assets throughout their lifecycle and has access to accurate and sufficient information.
section 1 - client-focused service establishment of service standards the treasury board guidelines on service standards notes that service standards are integral to good client services and to effectively managing performance.
"they help clarify expectations for clients and employees, drive service improvement, and contribute to results-based management."
the audit conducted interviews and examined documentation to determine if service standards were established for the contact centre.
"the contact centre reviewed its service standard in february 2016 and has plans to further assess it following a client survey that was launched in march 2017. at the time this audit report was being developed, the contact centre was in the process of analyzing the client survey results."
section 2 provides information on service standards results and monitoring and reporting.
availability of bilingual information officers the treasury board policy on official languages requires that bilingual offices communicate with and provide services to members of the public in the official language chosen by the member of the public.
"the audit team reviewed staff scheduling records and documentation on staffing actions, as well as interviewed contact centre management, to determine if mechanisms are in place to ensure the availability of bilingual information officers."
the audit requested information on official language complaints for the past three fiscal years in order to determine if current management practices were adequate.
"management advised that they are actively recruiting bilingual staff through a variety of staffing strategies, including adopting a -continuous inventory- approach to allow for an on-going receipt of applications with no cut-off date with the goal of attracting more candidates."
client authentication client authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a caller prior to releasing private information.
"under the personal information protection and electronic documents act, staff should be trained on privacy policies and practices and be aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information."
"to assess whether management has established controls to ensure that client authentication is performed, the audit team conducted interviews and examined documentation supporting the call authentication processes."
"the contact centre-s authentication procedures are outlined in the fipd administration manual, which is provided to information officers."
"in addition, in fall 2016, the contact centre reviewed the alignment of its call authentication procedures with the canada revenue agency call authentication procedures to ensure consistency in how verifications are performed."
training program and coaching the treasury board policy on service requires that learning opportunities regarding service-related knowledge and client-service excellence are given to service providers at the commencement of employment and on a regular basis.
"to assess this, the audit team reviewed the information officer training records and a sample of training material."
"this training includes general phone etiquette, caller authentication, public service principles (e.g. atip, information management, etc.) and on aafc program specifics."
the program also includes three days of training on service excellence.
"through the formal quality assurance program, initiated in 2016-2017, clients are informed that calls are recorded for training purposes."
team managers review recordings and provide information officers with coaching to maintain and enhance the quality of service delivered to clients.
"knowledge materials for information officers to provide accurate information to clients, the information officers require access to accurate and up-to-date program and departmental information."
"to assess if practices were in place to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is available for information officers, the audit team interviewed staff and management within the contact centre, the technical communications unit and on-boarded programs."
relevant manuals and material used to update program information were also reviewed.
an electronic manual of procedures on the fipd programs agriinvest and agristabilty is used by the contact centre.
these manuals are prepared and regularly updated by the technical communications unit within fipd.
the information officers use an evergreen knowledge repository that is maintained in the electronic service delivery support suite.
"this information is presented in a question and answer format, organized by program."
the initial knowledge elements were prepared by the programs and provided to the contact centre.
program managers are responsible for ensuring that program knowledge elements are updated as needed.
"client needs and feedback the treasury board policy on service notes that clients expect effective services that are integrated, simple, timely and secure."
"to meet these expectations, consideration must be given to the needs and feedback of clients and the implementation of strong service management practices."
"to assess the practices in place within the contact centre to obtain client feedback, the audit team conducted interviews with the contact centre and program managers and reviewed relevant documentation, including plans for client engagement."
"this plan articulates five streams of client engagement: (1) annual client satisfaction surveys, (2) a thematic public opinion research approach, (3) analysis of existing client feedback data, (4) the introduction of an employee service delivery survey, and (5) client journey mapping."
"as at the time of audit reporting in may 2017, the draft engagement plan was developed and awaiting formal review and approval."
contact centre management also informed the audit team that they encourage staff to provide their input on how to improve the client experience with the contact centre.
"in addition, employee feedback is obtained through staff polls and staff participation in operational working groups."
"section 2 - monitoring performance data and reporting the treasury board guideline on service management notes that most leading organizations establish performance metrics related to client service (for example, response times, number of rings) and collect data to monitor their own performance."
"evaluating service standard performance data determines organizational strengths and weaknesses, identifies progress, and sets priorities for future action."
"furthermore, the policy on service requires that service standard information be available on the external web site for external clients."
"the audit team conducted interviews and reviewed relevant documentation, including sample performance reports and service standard reports, to assess performance data monitoring and reporting."
"as noted in section 1 of this report, the contact centre has established a service standard to answer 90% of calls within 60 seconds."
"performance results are reported to internal stakeholders in weekly statistical reports, comparing the current week to year-to-date results."
"the contact centre also completes a quarterly analysis of enquiries received to assess the nature of calls including call tier level, capture changes to knowledge elements for information officers, and identify opportunities to improve client service."
mechanisms were in place to ensure consistent and quality service.
mechanisms were in place to obtain and act on client feedback to make service improvements.
performance data and service standards were reported to management and used to support decision-making.
"the following sections present the key observations, based on the evidence and analysis associated with the audit."
"there were no issues identified based on the audit work conducted, therefore no recommendations are provided in this report."
the audit found that the contact centre has established a formal service standard to answer 90 percent of all calls within 60 seconds.
"the service standard was established based on research in the private and public sector, as well as the behavior of clients and their willingness to hold."
"mechanisms to ensure quality of service to assess the processes and practices in place to ensure quality of service, the audit team reviewed the key risk areas identified during the audit-s planning phase, specifically: availability of bilingual information officers; client authentication; training program and coaching provided to information officers; and knowledge materials for information officers."
the audit team reviewed the contact centre schedules and confirmed that bilingual staff were scheduled for all operating hours of the contact centre in 2015-2016.
"internal audit confirmed that no official languages complaints were received during the previous three fiscal years, up to the time of audit testing (2014-2015 to february 2017)."
management stated that current staffing resource levels for the contact centre are appropriate although attracting and retaining bilingual staff remains an ongoing challenge due to the high demand for bilingual call agents in both the public and private sector in winnipeg.
the audit observed that the contact centre has mechanisms in place to ensure that information officers authenticate callers.
"specifically it: identified its sensitive information holdings to determine what information needs to be protected; developed client authentication processes to reduce the risk of inappropriate release of information; trained information officers on client authentication procedures; and monitored call quality, including client authentication, through its quality assurance program."
the audit found that there is a structured training program in place for information officers at the beginning of employment.
the audit team also reviewed staff training records and interviewed the trainers and confirmed that additional training is provided on program and system updates on an ongoing basis.
the audit team noted that the contact centre has practices in place to obtain an annual review and update of program information.
"in addition, the audit found that the contact centre has practices in place to ensure that correct and current information for the programs supported by the contact centre is available to information officers."
the audit noted that the farm income programs directorate (fipd) has drafted a client engagement plan which outlines a plan to formally capture client feedback on service delivery.
the audit found that appropriate data was available to monitor performance against the service standard and performance indicators.
the audit confirmed that the contact centre regularly reports its service standard results to external clients on the departmental web site.
"the contact centre surpassed the service standard in 2015, 2016, and for the period of january to march 2017. service standard results - external reporting percent of calls answered within 60 seconds: percent number calls received january to december) january to december) january to march) annex a: audit criteria line of enquiry 1 - client-focused service appropriate client service standards for the contact centre were established."
line of enquiry 2 - monitoring performance appropriate data was available to monitor performance and service standards.
the department has planned for the continued availability of its critical services the following section summarizes key observations on the state of continuity planning within the department.
continuity program governance the department has established a bcp program with supporting directives and tools.
"the emergency management and business continuity (embc) division, within isb, is responsible for the national coordination of the departmental bcp program (along with a number of other emergency management responsibilities)."
the embc division has been found to provide the required guidance and direction to branches and regions with respect to continuity planning.
"key stakeholders up to and including the branch assistant deputy ministers (adms) are involved in the development, approval, implementation and testing of plans."
"as a result, timely and coherent assessments of services are challenging."
"the embc division extracted a list of 22 programs and services that were deemed critical, 12 of which require recovery within a 0-72 hours range."
"supporting these services, a number of activities were identified and provide a foundation for a change to a -service-based- approach."
critical services that require recovery within a 0-72 hours range have not been prioritized amongst themselves.
"in the event of a horizontal disaster affecting multiple services, prioritization of services would benefit from being defined and agreed upon prior to the disruption."
continuity plans all 22 critical services have documented continuity plans and their associated recovery strategies.
the integration of continuity plans between branches and regions into -service-based- horizontal plans is not consistently performed but is improving.
"the department relies on other government entities, such as shared services canada (ssc) and public services and procurement canada (pspc), for achieving the delivery of some of its critical services."
arrangements are rarely documented or formalized to integrate the department-s plans and the plans of these government entities.
"even so, dialogue and collaboration is happening."
"for example, ssc and pspc were in attendance at the november 2016 table-top exercise."
"adopting a horizontal approach to continuity planning could facilitate coordination between the department and other government entities; this is not only desirable in cases where the department relies on external partners but also in cases where other government departments rely on employment and social development canada (esdc) for the delivery of their critical services (e.g. immigration, refugees and citizenship canada for the passport program)."
maintenance of readiness table-top exercises are conducted by some branches and at the departmental level to validate the content of plans.
one of the key lessons learned from the department-wide november 2016 table-top exercise was that -service-based- horizontal plans where multiple branches coordinate their efforts are essential to ensure the continued availability of critical services.
the department-wide november 2016 table-top exercise was also valuable in identifying challenges and provided a platform for discussing continuity planning in a horizontal manner.
we consider the regular conduct of continuity exercises a best practice to be continued.
"furthermore, external service providers and partners have been involved in the testing of business continuity plans."
this is also a best practice that ought to be continued.
lessons learned from exercises as well as real-life incidents are considered when reviewing and updating continuity plans.
overall observations better information management tools are required to allow for effective and efficient management of the bcp program.
bcp coordinators within branches and regions don-t always have the time or training to be effective continuity planning agents.
"the evolution towards continuity -subject matter experts- should be explored; the innovation, information and technology branch is moving in that direction."
the implementation of a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning is required treasury board-s operational security standard on bcp program promotes a -service-based- view of the organisation.
"consequently, impact assessments and continuity plans ought to target services, rather than operational units, directorates, branches or even business lines."
the department-s approach to continuity planning is outlined in the operational directive on business continuity management.
"this directive requires -managers at all levels across the portfolio, branches and regions- to complete business impact analyses and directors to complete continuity plans."
this approach creates an environment where the following processes supporting continuity planning become challenging to sustain.
"for example, call or processing centre managers are required by the directive to individually complete an impact analysis for the services their centre provides."
this has led some regions to group offices together that offer similar services in order to avoid duplication.
"the current approach results in individuals across the department to assess similar services, often in isolation."
"to alleviate this issue, the embc division has developed a business impact assessment companion guide to assist managers in completing their analysis in a comparable and coherent manner."
the number of business impact analyses completed (963) throughout the department makes the review and challenge function by the embc division difficult to sustain.
"this was intended to allow the embc division to review, challenge and compile a list of prioritized critical services with limited effort."
"for example, data entry was abandoned by some managers following technical issues; data integrity could not be enforced to ensure meaningful reporting; and half of expected reports could not be generated."
"as a result, a manual review and challenge had to be performed on thousands of business functions that were identified as -critical-."
continuity plans continuity plans across the department have been developed by directors and approved by directors general and adms.
"the resulting collection of division-level plans suffers issues similar to the issues associated with the impact analysis process such as duplication of effort to develop plans for similar services, time-consuming review and maintenance of the hundreds of resulting plans."
"when recovery strategies are fully implemented, this is not an issue."
plans developed in isolation cannot be effectively coordinated across the department.
"to ensure their continued delivery, all critical services require multiple interdependent branches to coordinate their recovery strategies."
"realizing that a more horizontal approach was necessary, the embc division worked with key branches to develop service-based -horizontal- plans."
"these plans for employment insurance (ei), the canada pension plan (cpp) and old age security (oas) were tested in the november 2016 department-wide table-top exercise."
other service-based -horizontal- continuity plans are expected to be completed in the coming years.
"while silos are still a challenge, and current -horizontal- plans are owned by distinct branches with references to other plans (e.g. ei plan referring to the citizen service plan), the department is moving in the right direction with the development of comprehensive horizontal plans."
collaborative efforts between national headquarter branches and regional delivery networks need to be supported to have a fully integrated approach to business continuity planning.
recommendation the adm of isb should adopt a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning that seeks to minimize effort duplication.
"this approach should be sustainable, coherent and consistent across the department."
management response isb agrees with the recommendation.
the department already adopted a horizontal service-based approach to business continuity planning which has been used for its most critical benefit services.
the business continuity management directive will be reviewed and revised to: align bcp activities with a horizontal service-based approach; streamline non-critical business line business continuity plans and minimize the need for manager level business impact assessments; and reduce duplication of effort for individual plans with similar business functions through horizontal service-based planning applying standardized business functions.
"isb, working with the innovation, information and technology branch will continue the process to acquire a suitable tool to support data management."
"the intent is that this application will address business continuity, disaster recovery, building emergency planning and emergency response."
a strong emphasis is being placed on application efficiency and the ability to interact with existing data sources.
"as of january 2017, these planned actions have already commenced with key activities scheduled to be completed over the next three fiscal years with full completion by march 2020. changes affecting the delivery of critical services require a stronger oversight of recovery options development, assessment, selection and implementation in an increasingly automated environment, complete and well-articulated assessments of recovery strategies are paramount if they are to be adequately funded and effectively supported by external service providers."
"for example, following years of automation efforts, ei has become highly dependent on it for both its intake and processing activities."
"in 2009, internal audit completed an assessment of ei-s continuity plan and concluded that, even at this early stage in the automation, -some functions essential to providing the service could not be restored within an acceptable timeframe at a minimum acceptable level should a disruptive event occur-."
"more than ever now, the capacity of the ei program to operate without its it infrastructure is limited considering the declining capacity to manually process claims."
"on the other hand, as observed by internal audit during the november 2016 table-top exercise, processes related to pension programs have a certain resiliency to it disruptions because they are still mostly paper-based."
the department has prioritized the implementation of digital tools and automated processes so canadians can access departmental services using digital self-service.
"to achieve this, a number of initiatives supported by investment projects are underway (e.g. cpp and oas service improvement strategies, ei automation agenda, benefits delivery modernization)."
"these initiatives will require the development, assessment, selection and implementation of updated recovery strategies."
"when pressed for time, technical testing of the recovery strategies is often limited and provides little assurance as to the viability of the it components of continuity plans."
ssc is now responsible for critical components of the it infrastructure supporting the delivery of departmental services.
"as a result, ensuring that roles and responsibilities are well defined for ssc and esdc is foundational to continuity."
"to this effect, the department has been working since 2015 on an it service continuity management framework that defines how ssc and esdc share the responsibility for service resumption."
"recommendation the adm of isb, in collaboration with the senior adm of the transformation and integrated service management branch, should develop processes to oversee the development, assessment, selection, funding and implementation of updated recovery options for critical services impacted by the implementation of digital tools and automated processes."
management response management agrees with the recommendation.
"isb, in collaboration with transformation and integrated service management branch, will develop a process to ensure that bcp is incorporated into all transformation initiatives and projects."
these measures will ensure that transformational projects adopt a bcp by design approach and measures for recovery strategies and associated costs are put in place during the project and for the future state.
this activity will build upon the development of a refined list of critical business functions grouped by service.
actions are expected to be completed by october 2017. conclusion the audit concluded that the department has planned for the continued availability of its critical services.
"furthermore, in an increasingly automated environment, recovery strategies need adequate management support, funding and coordination with internal and external supporting services to ensure the continued availability of the department-s critical services."
the conclusions are applicable only for the audit of business continuity planning.
the evidence was gathered in accordance with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada and the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing.
"however, integration within the strategic planning framework is challenging given the department-s decentralized siloed approach to continuity planning."
"critical services identification and prioritization all departmental services have been assessed as to criticality, however current processes have not been formalized and are inconsistent."
"however, most selected recovery strategies rarely detail their benefits, risks, feasibility and costs."
internal audit observed an increase in continuity planning related activities in the weeks preceding the exercise (e.g. increased branch working group meetings).
the leadership of the embc division alone is not sufficient to ensure adequate governance.
the continuity planning community could benefit from additional training to promote consistent understanding of terminology and practices.
business impact analyses for identification and prioritization of critical services the current approach to completing business impact analyses leads to the following issues: internal audit observed duplication of work between managers responsible for similar services.
however there is still duplication across regions resulting in impact analyses covering the same services.
internal audit observed some cases of over-classification where some non-critical services were assessed as critical.
"however, the data repository used to collect and analyse the information had system limitations and performance problems that compromised data entry, data integrity and reporting capability."
"furthermore, this approach which is aligned with the organisational structure of the department reinforces existing silos and does not foster a -service-based- view of the organization: current tactical division-level continuity plans are rarely integrated into branches- operational or strategic plans."
"however, when the recovery strategies are not fully funded or implemented, integration in a branch strategic or operational plan allows for better oversight of these strategies."
"isb, in collaboration with branches and regions, will adopt a prioritization approach working from highest risk to lower risk to ensure that detailed planning, recovery strategies and resources are put in place for all critical services."
"these new strategies have to take into account the increasing reliance on technology to deliver critical services and address the following issues noted by the audit: although recovery strategies are considered and proposed as part of investment or treasury board submission, they often receive limited funding leading to gaps in the recovery capability of the critical services they support."
"however, to be effective and efficient, a horizontal -service-based- approach to continuity planning needs to be implemented."
"statement of assurance in our professional judgement, sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were performed and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the conclusions reached and contained in this report."
the conclusions were based on observations and analyses at the time of our audit.
"appendix a: audit criteria assessment audit criteria rating bcp governance bcp is integrated into the department-s strategic and operational plans bcp involves key stakeholders that can provide adequate decision making and oversight conducting business impact assessments all departmental services have been assessed to determine which ones are likely to cause a high degree of injury to canadians or the working of government, if disrupted critical services have been prioritized based on maximum allowable downtime and the minimum service level required before a high degree of injury will result development of business continuity plans and arrangements for each critical service, continuity or recovery options have been analysed to recommend the most appropriate strategy for each critical service, comprehensive continuity plans based on the selected strategy are, as per applicable standards and policies: developed approved funded arrangements with internal and external service providers are in place so plans can be put into effect, and where the department shares in the delivery of a critical service, the plans are coordinated maintenance of bcp program readiness continuity plans are reviewed and updated as needed to account for changes to the services the department must deliver continuity plans are regularly tested and updated based on the results of those tests table-top exercises it technical aspects best practice sufficiently controlled, low risk exposure controlled, but should be strengthened, medium risk exposure missing key controls, high risk exposure"
"improvements are needed to increase senior management-s awareness and knowledge of the status of icfr through enhanced reporting and communication. additionally, improvements are needed to proactively involve business process owners through effective communication to ensure they understand and fulfil their roles and responsibilities in the icfr process."
"with the completion of the last operating effectiveness testing and the commencement of the ongoing monitoring process in fiscal year 2015-16, the management action plans addressing recommendations from the oag-s 2013 audit are completed."
"the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
"statement of conformance in my professional judgment as the chief audit executive, this audit was conducted in conformance with the institute of internal auditors' international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing and with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
"the plan was recommended by the departmental audit committee on september 27, 2016 and subsequently approved by the deputy minister of foreign affairs on october 17th, 2016."
"in 2009, treasury board introduced the policy on internal control (pic)."
the pic requires that the dms and chief financial officers (cfo) sign a statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting.
this document accompanies the departmental financial statements and acknowledges the responsibility of management for ensuring the maintenance of an effective system of icfr.
"additionally, icfr provides information that aids in the preparation of internal and external financial reports and statements in accordance with policies, directives and standards."
"finally, icfr helps to provide assurance that revenues received and expenditures made are in accordance with delegated authorities, and unauthorized or erroneous transactions that could have a material effect on financial information and financial statements are prevented or detected in a timely manner."
"icfr at global affairs canada the department of foreign affairs, trade and development-s (now global affairs canada) framework for internal control over financial reporting management (the framework) came into effect january 1, 2014."
this framework establishes the approach and defines roles and responsibilities regarding the system of icfr at global affairs canada.
the deputy minister of foreign affairs assumes overall responsibility and leadership for the measures taken to maintain an effective system of icfr.
senior departmental managers are responsible for ensuring that a system of icfr within their branch is well managed and effective.
heads of mission are responsible for ensuring that a system of icfr within their respective mission is well managed and effective.
managers at all level of the department are also accountable for the effective operations of controls in their respective business processes.
"lastly, the internal control team, within the corporate accounting, financial policies, and controls division (smo), is responsible for the development and maintenance of the framework and for the annual assessment of icfr."
the icfr process the icfr process is a documented series of activities that demonstrate that an effective system of internal controls is in place and operational.
"it ensures that due diligence required of the dms and cfo to sign the statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting, which accompanies the departmental financial statements (the annex), has been completed."
"for a visual representation of the icfr process, refer to appendix a."
it involved allocating the financial statement values between the department-s business processes and determining the most material business processes within the department.
information technology general controls (itgcs) - relative to the department-s general it infrastructure and systems.
"business process controls - both manual and automated, are embedded in business processes applicable to financial transactions."
these controls may change over time due to changes in the department-s business processes.
"control testing encompasses three components: design effectiveness testing, operating effectiveness testing, and ongoing monitoring."
design effectiveness testing the first step of control testing is design effectiveness testing.
"this testing determines whether the organization-s controls are designed to satisfy the organization-s control objectives, including preventing or detecting errors or fraud that could result in material misstatements in the financial statements."
"prior to fiscal year 2015-16, all material processes at the department were assessed for design effectiveness."
"operating effectiveness testing once the design effectiveness testing has been satisfied, each process undergoes operating effectiveness testing."
operating effectiveness testing assesses if the key controls (identified during design effectiveness testing) are operating as intended.
any significant control deficiencies identified will require a management action plan to address the control weaknesses.
all operating effectiveness testing must be completed before commencing ongoing monitoring of the processes.
"prior to fiscal year 2015-16, all material processes at the department were assessed for operating effectiveness, with the exception of the transfer payments for development programs process, which was completed in fiscal year 2015-16."
"ongoing monitoring once the design and operating effectiveness testing have both been completed on the business processes, the processes can enter into the ongoing monitoring phase of the control testing."
"reporting following the testing of controls, a report is produced to conclude on the effectiveness of the system of controls of the business process."
"if control weaknesses were identified during testing, they are reported to the process owners with recommended actions to mitigate them."
"audit results were derived from the examination of: related policies and documentation; methodologies and tools used by the internal control team for selecting and assessing key business processes and controls; and, interviews with key individuals responsible for implementing icfr."
"governance of the icfr process the governance of the icfr process is the combination of processes and structures implemented in order to direct, manage and monitor the activities of the department to adhere to the pic."
"at global affairs canada, these responsibilities are held by senior management (including the dms, adms, and cfo) and operationally by the internal control team."
"to evaluate governance of the icfr process at the department, the audit team reviewed departmental and government of canada documentation, committee records of decision, and communications with key stakeholders."
"icfr policy framework the internal control team developed the framework for the management of internal control over financial reporting (the framework), which is an overall guidance document that was approved by the deputy minister of foreign affairs on february 12, 2014."
"the framework defines icfr-related roles and responsibilities for key individuals (including executives, senior managers, and employees)."
"it also describes in greater detail the process to be followed to prepare the financial statements- annex, as well as the principles, control structure, assessment and the corrective actions process that should be followed."
"on the intranet page entitled -internal control-, the internal control team provides an overview of the pic, benefits to the department, challenges the department faces, the control processes to be covered, and the assessment process to be followed."
"relevant documents, including the framework, the pic, and the department-s financial statements, are also found on this intranet page."
"the dac mandate includes a requirement to provide advice on -departmental internal control arrangements, and be informed on all matters of significance-."
a review of the dac records of discussion for fiscal year 2015-16 and 2016-17 shows that the departmental financial statements with the associated annex to the statement of management responsibility including internal control over financial reporting (the annex) were presented to the dac in august of 2015 and 2016. no other discussions on icfr were noted in the dac records of decision.
"in addition to the reporting requirements to the dac, the framework states that the cfo is to present an update on icfr twice a year to the executive board."
the audit team also reviewed the terms of reference and records of decision in fiscal year 2015-16 for all other departmental executive committees.
reporting on the effectiveness of icfr to oversight bodies communicating the state of effectiveness of icfr is a key aspect of the icfr process.
the departmental senior executives and oversight bodies require timely reporting to stay informed of the icfr monitoring and compliance activities.
"though the 2015-2016 testing for the transfer payments process concluded that the controls were not operating effectively, these results were not clearly communicated to dac."
not clearly reporting significant findings to members of the executive board may limit their ability to properly conduct their roles and responsibilities pertaining to icfr.
assessment methodology and testing results were also reviewed to ensure that there was evidence to support the system of controls that are operating effectively.
"icfr process at global affairs canada in fiscal year 2015-16, the internal control team completed operating effectiveness testing on the transfer payments for development programs process."
"in addition, they implemented the department-s ongoing monitoring program."
"due to amalgamation-related priorities, this process was the last to require operating effectiveness testing."
"for the 13 manual controls tested, the audit concluded that detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed in a satisfactory manner by the internal control team for the operating effectiveness testing of transfer payments for development programs."
a special review was completed by contracted resources on the 7 key automated controls.
"the objective of this review was to support the department-s compliance with the pic, by assessing the design and operating effectiveness of the automated controls."
the detailed testing results were presented in a final report to the internal control team.
"for fiscal year 2015-16, the ongoing monitoring plan included the following key business processes: revenues, investments, and advances to international financial institutions, loans to developing countries and international financial institutions, and entity level controls."
these documents were used to update the key controls for each business process identified in the design and operating effectiveness testing.
the internal control team visits at least one mission per fiscal year to conduct ongoing monitoring of the controls.
"to select the mission(s), a mission financial assessment was conducted by the internal control team on four key business processes found in each mission: locally engaged staff payroll, capital assets, revenues, and payments."
the internal control team uses this list to select the mission(s) they will visit each fiscal year.
"key controls identification and testing due to the complex and differing operating environments of canada-s missions abroad, the internal control team identified 43 common key controls across different processes that each mission is expected to have in place."
key controls identification and testing testing activities were prepared and performed for the four kcosr activities identified.
better documentation of the process selection for kcosr would help provide clarity and assist decision making with respect to the ongoing monitoring program.
communication of icfr with business process owners communication with stakeholders is a key aspect of the icfr process.
"effective communication ensures that process owners understand their roles and responsibilities, which in turn supports an effective and well managed icfr system within their business unit."
"from this work, it was concluded that improvement is required in communicating icfr roles and responsibilities to process owners, and communicating testing results to senior management and oversight bodies."
"icfr roles and responsibilities communication senior management has overall responsibility for the management of the department, including the design, implementation, and monitoring of icfr and internal controls more broadly."
managers at all levels of the department are accountable for the effective operation of controls in their areas.
each business process is subject to controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the process operates effectively and that records accurately reflect individual transactions.
"with a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities for internal controls related to their processes, business process owners can play a proactive role to ensure the effectiveness of the internal controls."
in most cases the communication relates directly to the process assessments that the team performs.
"testing result communication once the testing of a business process is complete, the internal control team prepares a summary report with key observations and recommendations for the business process that was tested."
the report is shared with the director-level process owner who is provided with an opportunity to respond to the findings.
"feedback received from the process owner is incorporated into the final report which is then sent by the director general of smd to the director general(s) of the process, along with a management action plan for completion."
"the audit team reviewed all icfr assessment reports prepared for operating effectiveness and ongoing monitoring testing, including reports on the testing of key automated controls."
"all reports, which included management action plans, were shared with the process owners."
the internal control team has developed a follow-up plan for fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 to ensure that management action plans addressing control deficiencies were tracked and implemented in a timely fashion.
"while reports are being produced for each business process, it is not clear if or how the results of these tests are communicated with the departmental senior executives and oversight bodies."
"recommendation #2 the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
"progress update on 2013 oag audit recommendations in the fall of 2013, the department received a report from the office of the auditor general (oag) on their follow-up audit on internal controls over financial reporting."
"at that time, a commitment was made by the department to ensure that the requirements of the pic would be fully implemented in order to address the oag-s recommendations to that end."
"improvements are identified to increase senior management-s awareness and knowledge of the status of icfr through enhanced reporting and communication. additionally, improvements are needed to proactively involve business process owners through effective communication to ensure they understand and fulfil their roles and responsibilities in the icfr process."
"with the completion of the last operating effectiveness testing and the commencement of the on-going monitoring process in fiscal year 2015-16, the management action plans addressing recommendations from oag-s 2013 audit are fully implemented."
"appendix a: icfr process at global affairs canada appendix b: about the audit objective the objective of this audit was to assess whether the internal controls over financial reporting (icfr) process is effective, which ensures that key control gaps are identified and mitigated as needed."
the other objective of this audit was to assess if progress had been made in response to the oag-s 2013 audit recommendations.
the audit criteria were discussed and agreed upon with the auditees.
"senior management, including the deputy minister, is aware of and responsive to their icfr requirements, as per the policy on internal control (pic)."
"a governance structure is defined, implemented, and followed to comply with the pic requirements."
communication to the department is key with a clear -tone from the top- leading to success.
"roles and responsibilities for icfr are defined for, communicated to and followed by business process owner."
an adequate testing methodology for the icfr process exists and is applied consistently across all processes.
a testing methodology for the icfr process exists.
testing methodology is applied correctly for processes under audit scope.
results of key controls testing are documented and communicated to business process owners and senior management for decision/action.
follow-up activities were identified and communicated with the process owners a follow-up process is being implemented by the internal control team.
"the engagement provides an adequate overview of the subject area, which is of value to the organization."
"in order to achieve the intended outcomes, the following approach was used: initial study - gathering and examination of baseline information on pic initiatives, including but not limited to: analyzing non-financial information; and, policies, guidelines and procedures."
the information obtained was used to prepare for the preliminary meetings with senior management.
"preliminary meetings - interviews with the department-s senior management to obtain information related to challenges and delivery of the expected results from a perspective of ensuring that internal audit had a correct understanding of the current state of the process and, importantly, identifying areas of greatest management concern."
key control: a control that provides reasonable assurance that material errors will be prevented or detected in a timely manner.
materiality: extent to which a misstatement or an error of an item of information might reasonably be expected to influence the decision of the user of the financial information.
process owner: ultimately responsible for managing and overseeing the objectives and performance of a process through key performance indicators.
a process owner has the authority and ability to make required changes related to achieving process objectives.
the chief financial officer will report at least twice a year to oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr.
the next presentation will include a reminder of senior management-s responsibility with respect to internal control over financial reporting and a request for senior managers to further communicate this information to their teams.
icfr responsibilities are already included in all ex performance agreements.
"scm september 30, 2017 the chief financial officer should establish a communication plan for proactively engaging process owners throughout the full cycle of the icfr process to assist process owners to clearly understand what it is expected from their involvement in the icfr process, including their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control."
the chief financial officer will review its communication activities to proactively engage with process owners in the icfr process and provide information on their roles and responsibilities as they relate to the policy on internal control.
"smoc september 30, 2017 office of the chief audit executive, global affairs canada i type text]"
the overall conclusion of the audit team is that the process of internal controls over financial reporting is generally effective in identifying and mitigating the risk that the departmental financial statements may be materially misstated.
the department utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls at the department.
audit recommendations: the chief financial officer should provide sufficient and detailed information to the oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr to ensure that their roles and responsibilities as they pertain to the policy on internal control are fulfilled.
"sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were conducted, and evidence gathered, to support the accuracy of the findings and conclusion in this report, and to provide an audit level of assurance."
"the findings and conclusion are based on a comparison of the conditions, as they existed at the time, against pre-established audit criteria that were agreed upon with management and are only applicable to the entity examined and for the scope and time period covered by the audit."

"its objective is to ensure that -risks relating to the stewardship of public resources are adequately managed through effective internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting.- the pic states that the deputy heads (deputy ministers (dms)) are responsible for ensuring the establishment, maintenance, monitoring and review of the departmental system of internal controls to mitigate risks in the following broad categories: the effectiveness and efficiency of programs, operations and resource management, including safeguarding of assets; the reliability of financial reporting; and compliance with legislation, regulations, policies and delegated authorities. internal controls over financial reporting (icfr) provide a means by which management and users of financial statements can have confidence that the financial statements fairly reflect financial transactions."
"it is the role of the cfo to provide the dms with reasonable assurance that appropriate measures are taken to maintain an effective system of internal control, including leading the establishment and execution of an assessment plan."
"the icfr process consists of three main phases: risk assessment, control testing, and reporting."
risk assessment the first step of the icfr process is to conduct a risk assessment.
"the risk assessment helps in the development of the annual plan, determining which processes will be examined."
the internal control team completed a risk assessment for all business processes based on the department-s 2013-14 financial statements.
"the assessment on whether the department had an effective system of internal controls was based on the most material business processes grouped as follows: entity level controls (elcs) - present across the department and include measures taken by management to equip staff to adequately manage risks through raising awareness, providing appropriate knowledge and tools as well as developing skills."
it is expected that a risk assessment will be conducted on a periodic basis to ensure that the most material business processes are being assessed.
"control testing following the risk assessment, the internal control team conducts control testing on each of the processes to assess if they are operating effectively."
this step requires that the internal control team identifies the highest risk activities in the business processes and the key controls that would mitigate these risks.
"operating effectiveness testing is used to demonstrate the reliability of the key controls over a period of time, reducing risks related to financial reporting."
ongoing monitoring is defined by the framework as -periodic risk-based assessments as per a multi-year monitoring plan-.
"ongoing monitoring testing includes: the validation of the risks that need to be mitigated; a refresh of the process flowcharts and narratives to ensure that they represent the processes as they are currently functioning; and, an evaluation of the key control activities to confirm that they are still relevant and operating as intended."
observations and recommendations the audit team examined the management practice for the icfr based on the audit criteria described in appendix b.
"based on this work, observations and recommendations were made under the following themes: governance of the icfr process; a risk-based approach to business process selection and key control identification and assessment; and, communication with stakeholders."
"from this work, it was concluded that while sufficient processes and structures exist within the department to meet the governance requirement of the pic, improvement in communications from the cfo would be needed to further engage and obtain support from senior management and the process owners for the implementation of the icfr process."
the audit team confirmed that policies and documents in support of icfr are available for all staff on the department's intranet.
"icfr governance structure the framework designates the departmental audit committee (dac) as the main body responsible for providing objective advice and recommendations to the deputy ministers regarding the adequacy and functioning of the department-s risk management, and control and governance frameworks, including the assessment of the departmental system of icfr."
"though management indicated that verbal presentations were made to executive board, there is no evidence in the records of decision of executive board meetings from march 2015 to september 2016 that such updates on icfr were made."
"it was found that there was no direct reference to, or discussion on, the pic, icfr, or internal controls in general."
"however, as mentioned above, a review of all departmental executive committees- records of decision revealed that only one formal annual report, the financial statements- annex, was presented to one executive committee (the dac)."
"there is no evidence that these testing results were shared with the departmental executive committees, or that testing results were presented in detail in the departmental financial statements- annex."
"by not being fully informed of the results of the risk-based assessment results related to the effectiveness of the departmental system of icfr, there is a risk that the oversight bodies may not be able to effectively discharge their assigned responsibilities defined by the framework, including providing support and communicating periodically to the process owners and staff."
recommendation #1 the chief financial officer should provide sufficient and detailed information to the oversight bodies on the operation and effectiveness of icfr to ensure that their roles and responsibilities as they pertain to the policy on internal control are fulfilled.
"risk-based approach for process selection, control identification and control assessment as required by the pic, a risk-based approach must be used to assess the effectiveness of the system of internal controls."
the audit team examined the internal control team-s processes to determine if the work was completed using a risk-based approach.
this included examining if a risk-based approach was used to select the key business processes to be reviewed as part of the icfr process and to identify the key controls used to mitigate the processes- risks.
"from this work, it was concluded that a risk-based approach was used for process selection, control identification and control assessment."
"operating effectiveness testing risk-based process selection in fiscal year 2015-16, full-scope operating effectiveness testing was conducted on the transfer payment for development programs process by the internal control team."
it was the most material business process identified in the financial risk assessment and was therefore included as a key business process by the internal control team.
the audit team concludes that this process was chosen using a risk-based approach.
"key controls identification and testing based on validated process documentation, the internal control team conducted a risk assessment on the transfer payments process and identified 21 key controls (14 manual and 7 automated) that were the highest risk to the process."
the audit noted that 13 of the 14 key manual controls were applicable for the sample selected and therefore tested.
the audit team noted that two of the seven key automated controls were not tested as part of this review as they were deemed to be operating effectively in the design effectiveness phase.
"in conclusion, the audit examination confirmed that the key controls were identified based on a risk assessment."
testing results demonstrated that not all controls were operating effectively and therefore not mitigating the risks identified.
"selected key business processes monitoring risk-based process selection as part of the internal control team-s ongoing monitoring program, a three-year rotational testing plan for the key business processes identified in the risk assessment was developed."
the audit team concludes that the business process selection for the icfr ongoing monitoring program was through risk assessment.
key controls identification and testing the audit team noted that the business process documents (e.g. process flowchart and narratives) were validated with the process owners.
the key controls were identified based on the areas of highest risk related to each of the current processes.
detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed to demonstrate how the control activities were functioning and mitigating the risks identified.
mission-specific processes monitoring risk-based mission selection ongoing monitoring of missions- business processes occurs annually as part of the ongoing monitoring program because they were identified in the icfr risk assessment as a high risk control area.
"as a result of this risk assessment, the 15 highest risk missions (from a materiality perspective) were identified."
"in fiscal year 2015-16, the internal control team assessed canada-s mission in mexico city; this was one of the missions identified as being high risk in the assessment."
"additional risk factors that were considered in the selection of mexico city include the fact that the mission had a new financial management officer and management consular officer (mco), and that it was becoming a common service delivery point that will provide financial services to multiple surrounding missions."
"based on these factors, including the mission financial risk assessment, the audit team is in agreement with mexico city-s inclusion in the ongoing monitoring plan."
"these controls, in the form of the mission inventory of risks and key controls, are sent to all heads of mission and mcos."
the audit examination confirmed that the 43 key controls were identified based on a risk assessment.
detailed testing matrices were prepared and completed by the internal control team to demonstrate how controls in mexico city were functioning and mitigating the risks identified.
"key controls over significant risks monitoring risk-based selection as part of the department-s risk-based ongoing monitoring program, there will be annual reviews and testing of key controls over significant risks (kcosr) for those processes determined to be either high or medium risk."
this annual review is based on the internal control team-s risk assessment that identifies the risk level for each process and associated sub-process(s).
kcosrs of medium and high risk processes should be assessed on an annual basis to provide assurance that the department-s system of internal controls are operating as intended.
"with the introduction of the ongoing monitoring program, the internal control team only needs to test the key controls over significant risks that are not tested through an existing testing mechanism, if the mechanism is operating as intended."
"for fiscal year 2015-16, two processes that had high or medium risk sub-processes containing kcosrs were selected for testing: payments at headquarters and year-end procedures."
"for each of the processes, two kcosrs (four in total) were selected based on a detailed risk assessment and tested."
the testing conducted on the key risks was performed using a defined testing methodology similar to the ongoing monitoring methodology.
"overall, the audit team concludes that a risk-based approach is used by the department to identify the business processes to be assessed as part of the icfr process."
a risk-based approach is also used to determine if the business processes are operating as intended.
"instances where communication is key are: during the annual risk & control assessment and on-going business process update; while conducting the ongoing monitoring plan and assessment activities to determine if the system of internal control over financial reporting is effective; upon obtaining the results of the assessments; and, for the development and follow-up on implementation status of the management action plan."
the documentation review and interviews with identified process owners demonstrated that the internal control team communicates with process owners when required at different stages of the icfr process.
"nevertheless, interviews with six out of nine process owners identified a need to clarify their roles, responsibilities, obligations under icfr, and to be sufficiently informed of icfr."
"for example, the audit observed that there is a lack of consistent and clear understanding of the internal controls they are responsible for and how these control activities fit into the annual pic reporting."
"in addition, the audit team noted that the conclusions presented in each of the final testing reports were supported by the testing that was performed by the internal control team or contracted resources."
the need for remediation of control deficiencies is also prioritized according to the highest risk identified during the annual key control over significant risk assessment.
"the assessment results of the business processes are included at a high-level in the annex; however, there is no evidence to support that detailed results are being disseminated to senior management."
senior management is not provided the opportunity to see the complete assessment results and determine if any remedial action is required based on the control deficiencies- level of risk.
"the oag determined that the department was not on track to complete its assessments of internal controls, including addressing gaps and weaknesses, within the identified timelines."
"the department fully implemented the pic requirements in fiscal year end 2015-16, with the completion of operating effectiveness testing of the transfer payments for development programs and the implementation of a risk-based ongoing monitoring program."
overall conclusion the overall conclusion of the audit team is that the process of internal controls over financial reporting is generally effective in identifying and mitigating the risk that the departmental financial statements may be materially misstated.
the department utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
scope the scope of the audit included: operating effectiveness testing - transfer payments for development programs ongoing monitoring of the: entity-level controls process revenues process loans to developing countries and international financial institutions (ifis) investments and advances to ifis ongoing monitoring of mission specific processes ongoing monitoring of key controls over significant risks the audit also assessed the progress made in implementing the recommendations from the fall 2013 oag report.
criteria the following criteria were developed following the completion of the detailed risk assessment and considered the audit criteria related to the management accountability framework developed by the office of comptroller general of the treasury board secretariat.
"the following table outlines the audit criteria developed to meet the stated audit objective and audit scope: criteria sub-criteria accountabilities, roles and responsibilities for the icfr process are formally defined, communicated, exercised, and are supported by an appropriate level of governance structure."
"thorough risk assessments to identify and assess relevant risks are completed, monitored and updated."
an annual risk assessment of the overall icfr process is conducted to ensure highest risk areas are being monitored on an ongoing basis.
a process-level risk assessment was conducted for all processes under the audit scope.
"approach and methodology in order to conclude on the above criteria, and based on identified and assessed key risks and internal controls associated with the related business processes, the audit was completed according to the treasury board policy on internal audit and the audit standards of the institute of internal auditors."
the audit was identified as an audit priority and an area of high risk to global affairs canada in 2016-2019 rbap.
"a risk assessment was completed based on a review of documentation and interviews with stakeholders, including the internal control team (smoc) and a selection of process owners."
"overall, the assessment concluded that the main risks to global affairs canada are related to compliance with the policy on internal control (pic) in-terms of governance of the activity as whole, adequate risk assessments, effective testing, and sufficient follow-up on the gaps identified."
"detailed information gathering - the purpose of this approach was to: record, through interviews and documentation review, the department-s accountability requirements related to the pic and annex; assess through interviews, walkthroughs and documentation review, the level of over-all compliance to the pic; review through interviews and documentation review management-s response to weaknesses identified; and, at the conclusion of the audit, specific areas of interest will be considered for inclusion in the next annual risk-based audit plan."
the observations will assist management to identify potential risks in internal controls over financial reporting the department.
"appendix c: definitions as per the department-s framework for the management of internal control over financial reporting: internal control: a set of means to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance in the following categories: the effectiveness and efficiency of programs, operations and resource management, including safeguarding of assets; the reliability of financial reporting; and, compliance with legislation, regulations, policies, and delegated authorities. internal control over financial reporting: the subset of internal control that allows management and users of financial statements to have reasonable assurance that: transactions are appropriately authorized; financial records are properly maintained; assets are safeguarded; and applicable laws, regulations, and policies are followed."

this section provides the observations resulting from the audit work carried out.
the recommendation addressing these audit findings is located in the section following these observations.
compliance with legislation and regulations is inadequate.
important issues are identified that could negatively impact the achievement of program/operational objectives.
compliance with central agency/departmental policies and established procedures is inadequate.
issues are identified that could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
low controls are in place but the level of compliance varies.
compliance with central agency/departmental policies and established procedures varies.
issues identified are less significant but opportunities that could enhance operations exist.
"governance contributes to the strategic direction, oversight, decision-making, and accountability for an organization to successfully meet its objectives."
"further, while the mou guidelines identify some -accountable directorates or regions-, they do not specifically indicate what the accountabilities are or provide mechanisms for holding those directorates or regions accountable."
"finally, the chief financial officer (cfo) sector has a center of expertise (coe) in place along with the regional finance groups to help fulfill some of the roles and responsibilities of the cfo regarding partnerships and collaboration."
this coe currently consists of one employee.
"while the coe sees its role as primarily related to providing financial expertise and not covering mou, interviews found that others in the department have a much broader expectation of the coe, including all types of advice and direction related to partnerships and collaborations."
"the strategic policy sector used to have responsibility for mou, which may be contributing to the misunderstanding of roles, responsibilities and accountabilities."
"similarly, clear accountabilities help ensure agreements are properly implemented in line with policies and procedures and that goals and objectives are achieved."
oversight oversight at the program or regional level is not consistent across all phases of the partnerships and collaborations process and there is no oversight at the departmental level it was expected that an oversight function for partnerships and collaborations has been established and is operating effectively.
"currently, there is no treasury board or departmental policy that requires oversight for partnerships and collaborations at the departmental level."
the dfo directive on collaborations requires that a program level oversight function be established for reviewing proposed collaborative projects to ensure they comply with the directive.
"within the ecosystems and oceans science (eos) sector, where the majority of agreements related to partnerships and collaborations in the department reside, the sector recently created the office of partnerships and collaboration to provide oversight for these types of agreements."
"while this office is still being established, it is expected to act as a hub for partnerships and collaborations for eos, by providing employees expert advice and assistance in moving partnerships and collaborations through all phases of the agreement process."
"prior to the creation of this office, the sector-s only oversight mechanism was the science executive committee."
"while the office of partnerships and collaboration is specific to the eos sector, the canadian coast guard and other sectors within dfo have expressed interest in expanding their use of partnerships and collaborations, which would increase the need for a broader oversight function."
this finding is important because effective departmental oversight can help ensure partnerships and collaborations are aligned with departmental priorities and objectives.
"the department has also set up two intranet sites, one for collaborative agreements and another for mou."
"these intranet sites provide easy access to policies, procedures, tools and templates."
"the department also has two groups identified as providing support to partnerships and collaborations: a center of expertise (coe) within the cfo sector, and the office of partnerships and collaboration within the eos sector."
"interviewees mentioned that they often have difficulty with the lengthy partnerships and collaborations processes, as it is not part of their regularly assigned work."
"further, most programs and regions do not have staff dedicated to partnerships and collaborations to help move the arrangements through the processes."
"specifically, there are often lengthy discussions on which tool to use."
"also, the array and titles of current templates may be adding to the confusion for users."
"for example, collaborative agreement templates with other departments or levels of government are called mou templates but are expected to go through the collaborative agreements process according to the directive on collaboration."
this has also contributed to delays in finalizing some agreements.
"as part of the case studies, the time it took to complete each step of the approval process (from application to the signing of the agreement) was documented along with the time it took to get through the entire process up to signing of the agreement or mou."
"overall, it was found that the agreement that took the least amount of time was a collaborative agreement with another federal department that was completed in 115 days and the longest was a collaborative agreement with a non-government organization that took 445 days to complete."
"the main causes of the delays were related to confusion over the process and or which template to use, negotiations with external collaborators, navigating through the department-s and the external collaborator-s distinct processes and templates, oversight committee approvals and the requirement for reviews by subject matter experts."
"when there are adequate resources and clear guidance available on processes, tools and templates employees are able to successfully fulfill their roles and responsibilities, and enter into agreements in a timely basis to benefit from partnerships and collaborations that support the department-s goals and objectives."
"specifically, in the case studies, it was found that these forms were completed about 75% of the time, and there were inconsistencies in how they were completed, their level of rigour and accuracy."
"specifically, gaps in controls and some duplication were found."
"currently, all collaborative agreements must go through the same process, regardless of whether it is a renewal of an agreement with a long-term collaborator, an agreement with another federal department, or a brand new agreement with an organization the department has never dealt with in the past."
"the only part of the process for collaborative agreements that varies between agreements is the signing authorities, which are based solely on dollar amounts and the expert groups that need to be contacted."
"similarly, the level of controls for mou are comparable to those seen in the collaborative agreement process despite the fact that mou are with other departments or governments and do not include any transfer of funds or in-kind contributions."
this was supported by interviewees who expressed that many of the controls in place imposed costs on the process beyond the benefit they produced.
these included controls such as the requirement for all partnerships and collaborations to obtain approval to negotiate before discussions with the potential partner begin and the need to have all collaborative agreements go through the regional or sector oversight committees as well as regional or sector management.
this suggests that the decision to increase signing authorities was consistent with better alignment of costs with benefits.
"access to relevant, accurate and timely information is required to meet the department-s objectives."
"well-functioning information systems generate better decision-making, better compliance with policies and fewer problems."
"the main information system for partnerships and collaborations in the department is iagree, a standalone database."
interviewees also mentioned that iagree had technical issues including not properly refreshing after viewing files and retaining previous information when validating or making changes to an agreement.
"specifically, the aboriginal programs & governance information system, which houses contribution agreements along with basic client relationship management functions and performance measurement tracking, and icontribute, which is the departmental database used to manage grants and contributions, were mentioned."
"these findings are important because access to relevant, accurate and timely information, allows management to make informed decisions in support of departmental goals and objectives."
effective monitoring includes ensuring that deficiencies are communicated to management and are addressed in a timely manner.
monitoring promotes better alignment with departmental goals and objectives and that issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner.
"in addition, it requires that a short progress report be prepared annually and at the end of the agreement detailing the activities and achievements of the mou."
"similarly, the directive on collaboration identifies the cfo as being responsible for -monitoring internal management practices and taking necessary action to maintain a robust environment of internal control to address any instance of non-compliance- and that regional directors of finance and senior finance managers implement a standardized monitoring program for collaborative agreements to ensure they comply with the directive."
"also, none of these cases had any evidence that the progress reports were used or reported beyond the project authority to allow for identification of common issues or ensure expected results were achieved."
some alignment of monitoring with departmental objectives was found in that the oversight committees review collaborative agreement applications to ensure they are aligned with one of the department-s business lines.
it was expected that issues identified as a result of monitoring processes would be corrected in a timely manner.
"the mou guidelines state that if areas of improvement are identified during progress reporting, there may be a requirement to revisit the mou to determine how to make it more effective."
"also, the annual mou monitoring report requires that remedial measures be identified for deficiencies for each mou."
"according to interviews with senior management, there is no formal mechanism in place to ensure that issues are identified and remedied in a timely manner."
this finding is significant because a monitoring system in place that is linked to departmental objectives and remediates issues in a timely manner helps ensure alignment with departmental goals and objectives.
recommendation and management action plan it is recommended that the cfo coordinate a working group of sectors and the ccg to develop a management control framework for partnerships and collaborations.
management response: the cfo agrees to coordinate and lead a working group of sectors and the ccg to develop a management control framework for partnerships and collaborations.
"while there is oversight for individual mou and agreements, governance at the departmental level can be improved to ensure that they are properly managed."
the monitoring program at the agreement and departmental level could also be strengthened to ensure issues are identified in a timely manner.
the extent of the examination was planned to provide a reasonable level of assurance with respect to the audit criteria.
the opinion is applicable only to the entity examined and within the scope described herein.
the evidence was gathered in compliance with the treasury board policy and directive on internal audit.
"the audit conforms with the internal auditing standards for the government of canada, as supported by the results of the quality assurance and improvement program."
the procedures used meet the professional standards of the institute of internal auditors.
"appendix a: lines of enquiry and audit criteria the audit criteria are presented in the table below, by audit line of enquiry."
audit criteria line of enquiry 1 - governance (control environment) criterion 1.1: an oversight function for partnerships and collaborative arrangements has been established and is operating effectively.
"criterion 1.2: roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities are defined, documented, communicated, and understood."
line of enquiry 4 - information and communication criterion 4.1: information systems in place provide management with accurate and reliable information to support decision making in the management of partnerships and collaborative arrangements. line of enquiry 5 - monitoring criterion 5.1: a monitoring process or system is in place that is linked to departmental objectives and identifies and remediates deficiencies in a timely manner.
"while the audit was conducted based on the lines of enquiry and audit criteria identified in the planning phase, this report is structured along the following main themes: governance; risks and controls; information systems; and monitoring."
"based on the audit work performed and our professional judgment, the risk associated with each observation was rated using a three-point scale."
"the risk ranking (high, moderate, low) is based on the level of potential risk exposure we feel may have an impact on the achievement of fisheries and oceans canada objectives, and is indicative of the priority management should give to the observation."
the following criteria were used in determining the risk exposure: high controls are not in place or are inadequate.
moderate controls are in place but are not being sufficiently complied with.
"governance (moderate risk) governance is the combination of processes and structures implemented by management to inform, direct, manage and monitor the activities of the department toward the achievement of its objectives."
"the audit found that the department has a directive and guideline in place that identifies roles, responsibilities and processes for collaborative agreements."
"for example, the chief financial officer-s responsibilities include: directing the development, implementation and communication of the directive; developing training material, templates, guidelines, procedures and controls for the implementation of the directive; establishing a robust framework of effective management practices and controls to mitigate risks and provide assurance with respect to compliance with legislation, regulations, policies, directives and delegated authorities, for departmental collaboration; and monitoring internal management practices and taking necessary action(s) to maintain a robust environment of internal control and to address any instance of non-compliance."
"these findings were confirmed by interviewees who, while generally able to articulate what their roles and responsibilities were in relation to collaborative agreements, were not able to identify their accountabilities beyond general financial management."
"this finding is important because defined, documented and understood roles and responsibilities help ensure that processes are completed as intended and reduce the risk of duplication and inefficiencies."
"overall, the audit found that while there is some oversight at a program or sector level, there is no oversight function or mechanism at the departmental level that is able to monitor issues or practices from across the department to ensure consistency and co-ordination in the management and implementation of agreements."
"it could also improve the department-s ability to provide effective strategic direction, allocate appropriate resources, analyze activities related to exposure to risk and determine suitable mitigation strategies."
"finally, departmental level oversight reduces the risk that broad cross-region or sector issues will be missed."
"information, tools and processes employees do not have access to sufficient, clear information to carry out their roles and responsibilities and tools and processes are not well understood it was expected that employees would have the necessary training, tools, resources and information needed to successfully carry out their roles and responsibilities with respect to partnerships and collaborations."
"the audit found that the department has policies, procedures, tools and templates related to partnerships and collaborations that provide information and guidance."
"while the coe and office of partnerships and collaboration provide access to expertise in the area of collaborative agreements, regions and the coe identified a lack of resources as one of the main limiting factors in carrying out partnerships and collaborations roles and responsibilities."
"finally, the audit found that there was a general lack of understanding on how to use the tools and templates."
"based on the case studies and interviews, it was found that employees do not understand the process well, especially which templates should be used."
"this is not clear to many users and as a result, they are not consistently using the right template, process or both."
risks and controls (moderate risk) the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) defines risk as the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of objectives.
risk assessment involves a dynamic and iterative process for identifying and assessing risks to the achievement of objectives.
control activities are the actions established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management-s directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out.
controls are to be based on risks identified as being unacceptable and should be designed to bring the risk to an acceptable level.
"according to treasury board-s guide to integrated risk management, risk management -involves a systematic approach to setting the best course of action under uncertainty by identifying, assessing, understanding, making decisions on, and communicating risk issues.- no evidence of a systematic approach to risk for partnerships and collaborations was found."
"at the departmental level, the corporate risk profile (crp) was identified as the main risk management tool."
"while the crp does identify one risk area related to partnerships and collaborations, that of -program delivery risk-, only two of the identified action plans address items related to partnerships and collaborations and in both cases were for specific programs."
"also, while the crp is an annual exercise to identify the top risks for the department, the risk mitigation strategies are not actively monitored and the crp is not revisited until it is updated for the following year."
"as such, the crp is not an effective risk management tool for partnerships and collaborations."
"aside from the crp, no listing of key risks, or evidence of risk assessments for the partnerships and collaborations functions as a whole were found."
"further, the audit found that while risk assessments were completed for some agreements and mou, they assessed project specific risks, and were not rolled up to an overall risk assessment."
"specifically, the dfo mou guidelines require that an impact assessment be conducted for each mou to ensure that risks associated with the mou are identified and considered."
"while the impact assessment has some specific risk requirements to consider at the departmental level, when a separate sample of 5 impact assessments from ekme was selected and reviewed, inconsistencies in how they were completed and the rigour undertaken to complete the assessments were identified."
"similarly, the directive on collaboration requires that the impact of collaborative agreements on the department-s risk profile be properly evaluated, addressed and mitigated and senior management be informed of the impacts of risks that cannot be fully addressed or mitigated."
"this finding is important because identifying departmental risks helps ensure controls are appropriately based on those risks and allows management to determine which risks to accept, mitigate, or avoid."
"since no departmental level risk assessments for partnerships and collaborations were found, in order to test the alignment of controls to risks, the partnerships and collaborations processes were examined to identify possible key risks and compare them to the controls in place."
no other documentation was found to show that the controls were risk-based.
"also, while the directive states that monitoring of the directive -will be based on the principles of risk management-, no evidence was found to support that this was occurring."
"further, no evidence was found to demonstrate that the level of risk associated with an arrangement was considered in determining the process to be followed."
"finally, it was found that mou must go through many of the same controls regardless of whether the mou is with another federal department or an international government, despite significantly different risk levels."
"in examining costs versus benefits, no evidence was found during the audit to demonstrate that costs and benefits were considered in developing and implementing controls."
"although no evidence of cost benefit analysis was found, the financial signing authority levels for collaborative agreements were amended during the audit period to allow for increased signing authorities for collaborative agreements."
this finding is important because strong alignment of controls to risks reduces the likelihood of having an ineffective and inefficient system of controls.
information systems (moderate risk) coso states that the presence of an effective information system is a key component of a strong internal control structure.
the information system in place does not provide management with accurate and reliable information to support decision making in the management of partnerships and collaborative arrangements it was expected that the department would have in place an effective information system that would house partnerships and collaborations- data and would provide management with accurate and complete information for decision-making.
"to test for completeness of iagree, the ten case studies were examined to see if they were in iagree along with the required tombstone data and mandatory documentation in accordance with the mou guidelines and directive on collaboration. however, it was found that four of the ten case studies had not been entered into iagree."
while the percentage of arrangements missing from iagree cannot be applied to the database as a whole; additional testing based on mou and contribution agreements found in ekme also revealed significant numbers of missing arrangements.
"overall, it was not possible to determine how many agreements may not be in iagree, as the department does not currently have a reliable list of all partnerships and collaborations."
"similarly, financial data in some fields was not consistently entered correctly, such as entering the full value when it was supposed to be entered in thousands of dollars."
"also, based on interviews, it was found that several regions maintain their own spreadsheets and files to monitor their arrangements because iagree does not have sufficient functionality for their reporting and monitoring needs."
"specifically, iagree does not provide recent financial data, permit easy extraction of information in a useable format, or contain all the fields that are needed by the regions to effectively manage the agreements."
"finally, some interviewees stated that there are other data repositories that are used in the department that could be more useful and allow for more inclusion of key documents and correspondence."
"further, a reliable information system enables effective risk management and ensures compliance with policies."
monitoring (moderate risk) monitoring involves evaluating partnerships and collaborations against criteria established by regulators or management.
"finally, monitoring ensures that individual partnerships and collaborations, as well as partnerships and collaborations as a whole are being carried out according to plan, are appropriately managed and are on track to meet objectives."
the audit found that the mou guidelines require that indicators be developed to assess the agreement-s progress in accomplishing its objectives and that costs and resources to implement and maintain the mou be tracked.
"however, in the case studies, while all three mou type arrangements should have had a completed progress report, none did."
"further, there was no evidence that progress reports, or issues identified within a progress report, are consistently reported to appropriate management."
"during the audit, it was found that the cfo sector monitors the funds received by the department from cost-sharing agreements and specified purpose account agreements to ensure funds are appropriately accounted for and managed; however, no evidence of departmental monitoring was found related to internal management practices and compliance, neither was any implementation of a standardized monitoring program by the regional directors and senior finance managers found."
"further, inconsistent monitoring of the collaborative agreements was found in the case studies."
"of the seven collaborative agreements, four had progressed to a point where a progress report should have been completed; however, only three of those four had completed progress reports."
"however, there was no evidence of monitoring to ensure progress or results were in line with departmental objectives."
"further, all monitoring was of individual arrangements, no evidence of monitoring of partnerships and collaborations as a whole for alignment with departmental objectives was found."
the directive on collaboration does not provide any direction regarding issue identification and remediation and there was no evidence found in the audit of issues being raised from monitoring of collaborative agreements or mou.
"finally, no evidence was found to suggest that issues identified for mou and collaborative agreements are being consolidated to identify overarching trends for the department."
this control framework should ensure there is an effective information management system in place and include a streamlined suite of tools and processes that are risk based and balance cost versus benefits.
"the working group will review existing tools, processes and systems to ensure an effective information management system is in place and a streamlined, risk-based suite of tools and processes that balance cost versus benefits is implemented."
"target completion date: march 31, 2018 audit opinion the audit found that there are opportunities for improvement to ensure that the department has an adequate control framework to support partnerships and collaborative arrangements."
opportunities exist to enhance the partnerships and collaborations risk management system and approval process to ensure that controls are risk based.
"statement of conformance in my professional judgment as chief audit executive, sufficient and appropriate audit procedures have been conducted and evidence gathered to support the accuracy of the opinion provided and contained in this report."
"the opinion is based on a comparison of the conditions, as they existed at the time, against pre-established audit criteria that were agreed on with management."
the evidence gathered was sufficient to provide senior management with proof of the opinion derived from the internal audit.
"criterion 1.3: employees have the necessary training, tools, resources, and information to successfully carry out their responsibilities with respect to partnerships and collaborative arrangements. line of enquiry 2 - risk management criterion 2.1: an effective risk management system is in place to identify, analyze and manage risk, involves appropriate levels of management, and considers the acceptable tolerance level in relation to objectives."
"line of enquiry 3 - internal control system and activities criterion 3.1: control activities are aligned with key risks, consider costs versus benefits, and are conducted in a timely and consistent manner."
"this section sets out key findings and observations, divided into six general themes: accountability and oversight; planning and budgeting; monitoring; local procurement; asset management; and human resources and les staffing."
accountability and oversight it was expected that mission and headquarters management would exercise effective oversight over mission activities and expenditures to ensure solid stewardship of mission resources.
the audit examined roles and responsibilities of mission staff in the management of common services.
"accountability in the mission rests with the hom who reports to the assistant deputy minister (adm), geographic region, at hq."
"hq has a role in supporting and enforcing hom accountability, including the provision of common services."
"at the time of the audit, the hom had been posted to abuja for six months."
"furthermore, complexity was added to mission management from the transition to csdp brussels, the move to the new chancery and official residence, and ongoing projects related to the construction project and commissioning of the chancery."
the mission has a committee on mission management (cmm) which plays an oversight role.
another key oversight function at the mission is the contract review board (crb).
"this is due to limited tools and procurement knowledge on the part of the members, and the complexity and urgency of contracts related to projects for the new chancery and official residence."
"they are articulated in the terms of reference for the mission-s committee on mission management and the contract review board, performance management agreements, and policy and procedure documentation."
"the les play key roles in supporting mission management through their subject-matter, cultural and linguistic knowledge."
the audit team also found that tracking of variances between budget and expenditures was done informally as part of the monthly financial status (finstat) reporting process.
"while this practice is not a requirement, doing so could inform planning of procurement activities and support mission management decision-making."
this is especially important when working in a difficult environment.
"instead, staff quarters are rented, with maintenance fees included as part of the leases, which reduces the requirement to forecast for property maintenance."
"following the move to the new chancery, the mission incurred additional property maintenance costs related to issues with the new building."
these were included in its strategia forecasts for fiscal year 2016-2017.
the audit also found that limited planning and tracking is performed for vehicle maintenance.
"while maintenance is performed prior to trips outside of abuja and on an ad hoc basis, the information is not recorded."
this limits the mission-s ability to track vehicle performance and plan for future requirements.
"in one example, 25 tires were purchased for 5 of the official vehicles at the end of march 2016, despite new tires having already been purchased and installed in summer 2015."
the purchased tires remained uninstalled at the time of the site visit in january 2017.
monitoring it was expected that monitoring activities would be performed to provide general information on mission compliance with government of canada and department specific policies and procedures.
"procurement the audit team expected to find a monitoring and reporting process to support procurement activities in compliance with relevant policies and legislative requirements, and to achieve value for money."
"for example, there is no information on the number of contracts awarded, sole source contracts, amendments or changes to contracts."
this limits the management-s ability to carry out effective monitoring and oversight.
"there is also no comparison of diesel and gas consumption for official vehicles to vehicle mileage, or an assessment of fuel remaining in the mission reservoirs as compared to fuel sold to mission staff and consumed by official vehicles and generators."
the audit team compared data on mileage recorded in vehicle logs with fuel consumption for a sample of official vehicles.
overtime another area of concern to the audit team was the monitoring of les overtime.
the audit team examined the overtime paid to the les staff working within the cs program and found that overtime was pre-authorized.
"the audit team expected to find overtime reports and trend analysis prepared by management, and processes in place to identify excessive use or other issues."
the audit team conducted a trend analysis and noted a significant amount of overtime incurred by drivers over the period of the audit.
this was despite the fact that overtime paid in cash in 2016-2017 decreased compared to 2015-2016.
the audit team examined the mechanisms and tools in place to procure goods and services at the mission.
the audit team selected a judgmental sample of contracts and procurement transactions from april 2015 to january 2017.
the audit team expected to find that the mission procures goods and services in compliance with regulations while achieving value for money.
a review of a sample of contracts and procurement transactions revealed instances of non-compliance with contracting regulations and policies.
"this resulted in invoice payments not being linked to a purchase order and contracts greater than $10,000 not being disclosed as required by proactive disclosure requirements."
the audit team expected to find that contracts were managed in compliance with their terms and conditions.
"in one instance, the contract was signed after the work had commenced."
"in another instance, the supplier was paid a lump sum instead of two separate payments as set out in the contract."
"in another instance, a contract employee was paid a higher overtime rate than the one specified in the contract."
"in yet another instance, the value of the contract was significantly exceeded without a contract amendment."
"the audit team also found instances where excessive quantity of goods and services were purchased (for example: fleet maintenance and repairs, vehicle parts, and fuel) or the price paid for the same goods varied."
"in addition, there were instances found in which prices of diesel were inflated."
"to examine this area, the audit team focussed on the management of inventory, vehicles and cash."
"the corporate inventory tracking system, radio frequency identification device (rfid), is not being used by the mission."
"despite this, the audit team verified the existence of selected items on the inventory list and appliances purchased and found no material errors."
"when the audit team compared a sample of records of vehicle part purchases with the inventory and invoices for vehicle repairs, the audit team could not trace any of these parts."
the storage room is not kept locked making it accessible to all.
the mission has two fuel dispensers for gasoline and diesel respectively.
"the diesel dispenser is for official vehicles only, and the gasoline dispenser is for both official vehicles and for mission staff on a cost recovery basis (selling gasoline to staff)."
this limits the effectiveness of the cost recovery and completeness of information to monitor the usage of gasoline.
"specifically, in the last two fiscal years, diesel consumption has significantly increased (increase of 50% in 2015-2016 and 82% in 2016-2017)."
a review of a sample of maintenance invoices and vehicle logs showed that some vehicles had excessive engine oil changes and brake pads replacements.
"without vehicle maintenance logs, management cannot assess the reasonability and legitimacy of repairs and maintenance expenditures."
"cash and collection of revenues the mission requires a cash supply for small, urgent or unique purchases not covered by other means."
"the mission has two petty cash accounts of about $2,000 each."
the first account is used to pay for some security services provided by local authorities and the second is used to pay for property and material related expenses.
the audit team shared the findings with the inspector general office for further investigations.
"human resources - les staffing the audit team was advised by mission staff that for 2016-2017, human resources (hr) planning activities were documented directly in strategia rather than in a formal plan."
the mission receives support from the regional service centre - london for its staffing actions.
minimal les staffing actions took place during the audit period due to low turnover.
the audit team examined the single staffing action that took place in 2016-2017 for the financial officer who made a lateral move to common services after the csdp transition.
the staffing action was handled by the rsc who communicated with candidates.
key documentation to support the above was provided.
conclusion the audit team concluded that there were significant weaknesses in the management practices and controls in place to ensure good stewardship of resources at the abuja mission to support the achievement of global affairs canada-s objectives.
"processes established by hq relating to finance, procurement, contracting, revenues, and human resources were not consistently followed and some key controls were not in place or were circumvented."
"as a result of the audit findings, information was shared with the department-s special investigations division for further work."
the audit team verbally debriefed the hom and the mco after completion of work on-site.
"as a result, mission management has taken measures to address issues identified by the audit."
"the head of mission should ensure that responsibilities and accountabilities of canada-based staff and locally engaged staff are communicated, consequences of poor performance reflected in performance appraisals and corrective actions taken when required."
"the head of mission should take measures to strengthen oversight, controls and monitoring for common services to ensure procurement and contracting processes comply with regulations, proper management of the inventory cycle is undertaken, with corrective actions when non-compliance is detected."
"recommendations to headquarters: the assistant deputy ministers, geographic branch, should ensure that responsibilities and accountabilities of the heads of mission are communicated; consequences of poor performance are reflected in performance appraisals and corrective actions taken when required."
appendix a: organization chart for common services and consular programs appendix b: about the audit objective the objective of this audit was to provide assurance that sound management practices and effective controls are in place to ensure good stewardship of resources at the abuja mission to support the achievement of global affairs canada objectives.
scope the scope of the audit included those management practices and controls in place to support the abuja mission operations excluding the administrative services provided to the mission in lagos.
"specifically, the audit examined processes related to the collection of consular fees, procurement and asset management (including cash, materials, vehicles and property)."
"human resource processes relating to les staffing actions, les payroll and overtime were also examined."
the most up-to-date documentation available as at january 2017 was reviewed.
"in addition, common services program expenditures and data for property and fleet were examined from 2013-2014 to 2016-17."
criterion 1: adequate and effective oversight and accountability are in place to support stewardship of mission resources.
"management exercises effective oversight of procurement, asset management and human resource activities."

"monitoring and reporting of procurement, asset management and human resource activities take place to inform decision-making."
criterion 2: effective management practices and controls are in place to ensure stewardship of mission resources and compliance with relevant policies and legislative requirements.
effective controls are in place to ensure that procurement of goods and services comply with relevant policies and legislative requirements and achieve value for money.
cash is managed in accordance with relevant policies and legislative requirements.
"les staffing actions comply with relevant policies and legislative requirements and are fair, open and transparent."
les salaries and overtime payments are accurate and complete.
"during the next fiscal year, mission will conduct a thorough analysis of the planning and budgeting."
the accountability structure will be communicated to all parties and used as the basis for developing an implementation plans.
"mission has implemented alternate methods to minimize transactions and reduce reliance on cash (i.e. acquisition cards, electronic fund transfers)."
mission will conduct frequent (quarterly) spot checks of petty cash accounts to ensure accuracy.
mission will reinforce the financial tracking with a calendarized checklist to confirm that all steps relating to the accounts verification have been performed and that all required documentation is on file.
this process will include evidence of who has performed the accounts verification and what has been performed.
common services team will work collaboratively with all programs to ensure that roles and responsibilities are clearly delineated to support accountability.
"head of mission / abuja december 2017 may 2018 already implemented september 2017 september 2017 october 2017 september 2017 the head of mission should ensure that responsibilities and accountabilities of canada-based staff and locally engaged staff are communicated, consequences of poor performance reflected in performance appraisals and corrective actions taken when required."
"mission will initiate a formal horizontal communications process to communicate roles and responsibilities and to promote best practices that will be disseminated to staff through meetings, workshops, and messages."
mission-s wiki site will be updated to provide a repository for policy and procedures reference points.
common services is now monitoring the completion of the locally engaged staff performance management programs for all programs and will provide a status report to committee on mission management (first update will be provided to program managers in september).
quarterly reminders will be sent to all staff in concert with the performance management program cycle.
on arrival of current head of mission clear requirements were communicated via committee on mission management and management bilateral regarding performance management program completion usage.
mission is now fully compliant with performance management performance requirements and will continue to use the program to manage performance.
training on employee performance plan development and monitoring will be undertaken.
mission will discuss options for incorporating performance measures into performance management programs for employees and executives through consultations with committee on mission management as an opportunity to implement formal feedback to head of mission and management and consular officer when performance issues arise.
"head of mission / abuja august 2017 september 2017 already implemented august 2017 august 2017 the head of mission should take measures to strengthen oversight, controls and monitoring for common services to ensure procurement and contracting processes comply with regulations, proper management of the inventory cycle is undertaken, with corrective actions when non-compliance is detected."
"all procurement staff will receive training or refresher training on the use of public services and procurement canada-s standing offers, supply arrangements, etc. and pay closer attention to the application of required processes when using these tools."
the mission will develop a multi-year capital acquisition plan to be tabled annually at committee on mission management to coincide with budget forecast preparations for review and approval.
mission will ensure that procurement and contracting procedures have been documented and communicated to all staff involved in the process.
staff quarters inventories are reviewed with the occupants and occupancy agreement is signed within 30 days of occupancy.
official residence inventories will be completed this fy 2017-2018 the overall mission-s inventory and management of assets will be recorded by the end of the current fiscal year through automation and integration with information management system.
mission will complete a map of key procurement control processes to reflect goods and services practices.
"a performance measurement framework will be developed to assist operationalize performance tracking identified in the property plan for fy 2018-2019. that will include, indicators of operational effectiveness and efficiency, which could include: expenditures vs. deliverables."
this information will be used to track performance and identify trends.
enforcing the records management strategy to allow tracking of results.
improving the asset management planning functions to support decision making.
decisions with regards to asset management planning will be made through the committee on mission management.
"also, the committee on mission management will be provided with reports on performance targets for funds invested in the maintenance and repairs of the portfolio."
mission will improve contract files through the use of a checklist and ensuring that the complete contracting process is documented.
this will greatly enhance management-s ability to defend a process and to provide auditable records when necessary.
mission commits to provide quarterly reports to the head of mission on all contracts approved at the contract review board.
ensure that staff members involved in the contracting function are provided with the proper training.
mission will ensure that vehicle logs and fuel purchases are analyzed against consumption (e.g. mileage/usage rates for vehicles and generators) mission will ensure that the overtime trend is analyzed as a best practice and control.
"head of mission / abuja september 2017 december 2017 september 2017 september 2017 september 2017 december 2017 september 2017 june 2018 april 2018 september 2017 september 2017 already implemented september 2017 audit recommendation to headquarters management action plan area responsible expected completion date the assistant deputy ministers, geographic branch, should ensure that responsibilities and accountabilities of the heads of mission are communicated; consequences of poor performance are reflected in performance appraisals and corrective actions taken when required."
"the assistant deputy minister, asia pacific branch, will ensure that the head of mission responsibilities and accountabilities related to sound management practices and stewardship of resources are communicated via the head of mission mandate letters and executive performance agreement objectives/indicators."
"the importance of maintaining sound management practices and stewardship of resources is, and will continue to be, communicated via quarterly the assistant deputy minister/head of mission calls and in quarterly director general messages (dg grams) to heads of mission."
poor performance in this area will be reflected in the head of mission performance appraisals.
"responsibilities and accountabilities of the heads of mission are currently communicated by the responsible assistant deputy minister and director general through a number of mechanisms: extended branch management meetings which take place every six weeks (assistant deputy minister level) director general/head of mission telephone calls every week (director general level) bilateral director general - head of mission calls related to nigeria take place monthly, with more frequent engagement as needed performance management agreement process - beginning of the year, mid-year and year-end."
audit follow-up is part of performance management agreement content.
"director general or assistant deputy minister engagement and intervention on specific issues, as required."
"to address concerns raised in the audit, the director general will ensure that the head of mission addresses the mission-specific recommendations, and reports on actions taken."
failure to do so will be reflected in the head of mission-s performance management agreement.
"starting this year, letters will be sent to all new heads of mission by the assistant deputy minister outlining broad expectations, including mission management and stewardship of resources."
"(last year, letters were sent only to new, first-time heads of mission)."
"new this year, heads of mission will be expected to report on how they have met the stated expectations."
"europe, middle east, maghreb and circumpolar affairs branch accepts the recommendation and will implement it through discussions between the assistant deputy minister, relevant director generals and heads of mission during the year, specifically during the performance management agreement process."
"assistant deputy minister, asia pacific branch assistant deputy minister, sub-saharan africa branch assistant deputy minister, europe, eurasia, middle east, maghreb and circumpolar affairs branch september 2017 ongoing letters to be sent when all new heads of mission are announced."
"in terms of immediate measures, the international platform branch is delivering enhanced training to management and consular officers in the field, with the support of the canadian foreign service institute, focused on fraud awareness and financial management in a regional context- in particular those managing the common services delivery points."
the international platform branch is also proactively engaged in planning/participating in inspections of common services delivery points ; generates lessons learned from feedback received from missions and partners as implementation of the common services delivery point model moves forward; and consults with other ministries of foreign affairs regarding lessons learned and best practices related to similar issues.
the fraud awareness training has been made mandatory for all management and consular officers this year and over 30 outgoing management and consular officers have had an intensive one day fraud awareness training before they depart for post.
"approximately 60 outgoing program managers, 15 foreign service executive administrative assistants and 40 new heads of missions have had fraud awareness included in their pre-departure training program."
an online fraud awareness course will be developed.
revisions of assignment guidelines for 2018 assignments will consider adding that all applicants put down at least one hardship mission amongst their six assignment preferences.
"rotationality as a condition of employment is also being reinforced in consultation with managers, employees and unions in an effort to expand the assignment horizons of our existing employees."
business needs will be better balanced against employees preferences.
"as the competency-based approach matures, it can better track the competencies and experiences of employees and the requirements of the positions."
"the approach will also permit the department to better identify and track the training requirements, integrated into the assignment process."
"assistant deputy minister, human resources branch september 2018 june 2017 july 2017 november 2017 september 2017 july 2018 september 2018"
"the hom-s responsibilities also include lagos, a second medium-sized mission in a high-risk environment."
the audit team found that this created significant burden on mission management.
"while mission management made considerable efforts to manage critical operational issues and ensure safety and security of personnel, it did not exercise adequate oversight and monitoring of regular operations, such as consular revenues, diesel purchase and delivery, overtime, and vehicle maintenance."
"the audit found that the cmm meets regularly on a monthly basis, and discusses a range of issues, including budgets, asset maintenance and usage."
the audit team found that the crb does not function as effectively as it could.
"the audit team noted that cbs roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities are clear, communicated and documented."
"in addition, between rotation cycles, handover notes from outgoing to incoming cbs were prepared; however, some key elements were not included, such as issues with contracting processes and consular revenues."
"despite roles and responsibilities being clearly articulated, the audit team observed that cbs do not always have sufficient knowledge required and the tools needed to perform their duties."
"since the les remain at the mission while the cbs rotate, it would be expected that they provide consistency in carrying out the appropriate processes and procedures that comply with government of canada policies and the mandate of the department."
"the audit team found that although les roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated through performance management agreements, les do not have sufficient knowledge and tools required to carry out their responsibilities."
"however, a more detailed breakdown of planned activities and expenditures was not developed to support the day-to-day activities of the mission, for example, diesel consumption of generators and vehicles."
"however, the mission does not perform a detailed needs analysis on its expenses, which limits the accuracy of its forecasts."
"a significant spike in spending on goods and utilities was noted in march 2016, which is indicative of limited planning."
"however, the mission-s management does not use the corporate business warehouse and business intelligence software tools to extract data in order to conduct trend analysis of prior years- expenditures."
the audit team found that management is not provided with procurement reports or information on procurement trends that could highlight irregularities or areas of higher risk.
"the audit team noted that while records are kept for a variety of activities and assets (for example: gasoline and diesel consumption, driver logs, and office supply inventory), the information is not analyzed to inform decision-making."
"for example, the audit team noted that vehicle maintenance (including repairs and purchasing of parts) is not tracked or monitored."
"in addition, the audit team compared maintenance and repairs records with mileage incurred and found that the frequency of maintenance was not reasonable."
"without information and data on the conditions and usage of assets and materials, it is difficult for management to ensure that asset management is carried out based on life cycle needs, and areas of higher risk of misuse and corrective measures are identified."
the audit team found limited monitoring of overtime.
"a review of a sample of overtime transactions revealed that while drivers- time sheets were compared to daily vehicles- logs, mission management was not tracking overtime or conducting trend analysis."
"in addition, management did not perform a challenge function for drivers- overtime usage."
"in cases where the audit team found overtime to be excessive, monitoring had not been performed to detect or to address such excesses."
this lack of monitoring leads to an increased risk that overtime may not be warranted or actually performed.
the audit team did not find any evidence that mission management examined options to optimize the use of the mission resources.
"for instance, all drivers worked the same 7:30am to 4:30pm schedule, which does not necessarily meet the mission-s operational requirements."
"the audit team found that through data analysis and review of overtime transactions that in some cases, the total hours of work including overtime were unreasonable."
"specifically, records indicated some drivers worked between 10 and 18 hours per day, sometimes for several months and including days of rest."
"adopting a shift schedule would reduce the cost of overtime, and the health and safety risk related to working such long hours."
local procurement local procurement was identified as an area of risk during the audit planning phase.
"in some instances, there was no evidence that three quotes for goods and services had been obtained in order to select the one that provided the best value for money."
"in addition, the audit team noted that the majority of contracts were not entered into the departmental financial and administrative system (fas)."
"from a review of a sample of contracts, the audit team found several instances where the contract was paid in full in advance of services received."
"furthermore, a review of a sample of procurement transactions showed that due diligence under section 34 was not always carried out by the responsible cbs to ensure proper use of departmental funds."
"specifically, when invoices were received, there was no certification of work performed or goods received."
asset management another area of increased risk identified by the audit team was the management of assets at the mission.
"inventory the audit team expected that once an asset is purchased it would be appropriately recorded, safeguarded, tracked and disposed according to the related policies and procedures."
the audit team found limited management of inventory at abuja mission.
the audit team did not find a formal mechanism to manage and monitor inventory.
records of assets are kept in hard copy format but are not sufficiently detailed and up-to-date.
"for example, the mission-s inventory of appliances does not track information about model and serial number, location, movement, or repair history."
the audit team was unable to assess whether parts purchased by the mission such as tires and armoured vehicle parts were received as there was no tracking of vehicles parts.
the audit team also found a lack of physical controls over inventory.
the lack of tracking of movement of assets and the absence of physical controls increases the risk of potential loss of assets.
the audit found that there is a log book for the two dispensers.
"the quantity of gasoline sold to staff is noted in the official receipts remitted to staff; however, it is not recorded in the gasoline dispenser-s log."
"the audit team also found a lack of access controls to the dispenser; specifically, keys for the two dispensers were not locked and there is no segregation of duties relating to fuel filling."
the audit team noted that diesel purchases represent important common service expenditure as the mission relies on the generators as its main power source after having moved to the new chancery.
the fuel tanks and dispensers are connected to the building management system which was not working properly due to the poor installation.
"furthermore, the audit team found no controls over the delivery process of diesel, such as recording and verifying the quantity of diesel delivered."
"in addition, at the time of the audit, the mission was unable to calculate the volume of diesel delivered and consumed."
"as a result, data was not collected for controls and monitoring purposes."
fleet management the audit team noted a lack of controls over vehicle maintenance (including repairs and purchasing of parts) and fuel consumption.
"there were no maintenance logs for official vehicles, making it difficult to assess whether vehicle maintenance was carried based on life-cycle needs."
"furthermore, there was a lack of controls to ensure that maintenance and repairs were required and services and parts were provided to the satisfaction of the mission."
a review of a sample of the second petty cash transactions indicated that some supporting documentation was incomplete or missing.
